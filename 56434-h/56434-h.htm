<p>Sir Foster Kerrison's entrance into the great
drawing-room at Wetheral was an epoch in its
annals. It was the precursor of stirring matter.
Lady Wetheral received him with great amenity
of manner; and any other gentleman might have
perceived a look of anxious care in her eyes.
Sir Foster, however, saw nothing; he did not
even observe that her ladyship was alone. Habit
directed him to a seat in the direction of the
lounging-chair, which stood in the boudoir, and
when his hat was placed upon a table, there
was nothing to interfere with his <i>dolce far niente</i>.
Sir Foster sat down, tapping his boot and winking
his eye, in happy ignorance of coming events.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Wetheral allowed some little time to
elapse in silence, ere she commenced proceedings;
but, when Sir Foster had taken root, and
looked steadily deposited for three hours at
least, the case was gently opened. Lady Wetheral
drew near, and seated herself opposite
her neighbour.</p>

<p>"Sir Foster Kerrison, I beg your attention for
a few moments."</p>

<p>Sir Foster made no reply, but a rather
quickened tapping of the boot assured her she
was heard. Miss Kerrison had innocently
enough supplied the key to her father's meaning,
and movements.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, my dear Sir Foster, you are
somewhat surprised at the absence of Lucy and
Clara."</p>

<p>Sir Foster looked round the room, and smiled.</p>

<p>"Clara is not allowed to return again to your
society, my dear Sir Foster, for very essential
and painful reasons." Lady Wetheral paused,
but she might have continued <i>ad libitum</i> for
hours: Sir Foster neither perceived the absence
of his daughter and Clara, nor understood the
drift of her remarks. Lady Wetheral's quickness
detected at once the obtuseness of her
companion; she perceived the uselessness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
hints and sighs, and broken sentences, in the
present instance. Tom Pynsent yielded at once
to their influence, but Sir Foster required a
<i>coup de main</i> to rouse his feelings and attention.
Another line of conduct was therefore chosen.</p>

<p>"Sir Foster Kerrison, you have behaved very
ill to my daughter!"</p>

<p>"God bless me!" cried Sir Foster, almost
starting. "Eh! what?"</p>

<p>"If your intentions are not honourable, Sir
Foster Kerrison, I, as a mother, demand a
change of conduct on your part."</p>

<p>"Lucy ill, or any thing?" demanded Sir
Foster, in surprise.</p>

<p>"<i>Miss Kerrison</i> is well," replied Lady Wetheral,
with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Oh, umph!"</p>

<p>Sir Foster sank again comfortably into the
arm-chair.</p>

<p>Provoking man! Was there no way of chaining
such a creature? Her ladyship's patience
was inexhaustible. Perhaps a still more decided
manner might effect the purpose. Lady Wetheral
took a high tone.</p>

<p>"Sir Foster Kerrison, the neighbourhood
have reported you are addressing my daughter.
I wish to know if you are aware of this report:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Miss Wetheral shall not be trifled with, Sir
Foster!"</p>

<p>The tapping increased in velocity, and Sir
Foster's eye winked with prodigious rapidity.
Her ladyship became gradually more resolute
and parental.</p>

<p>"If my child is to be made wretched, Sir
Foster Kerrison, a mother's offended heart will
urge its claims to be heard, and her lips will express
its horror at such baseness. She will tell
you how detestably wicked it is to come, day
after day, and sit hours, with an innocent, trusting
girl, who fondly believes there is truth and
honour in your soul. No parent can mistake
the aim of your visits, Sir Foster, but I will
know if it is meant in honour. I will hear no
base apologies, no wicked evasions&mdash;is my
daughter to be Lady Kerrison, or is she to pine
away in solitary, unrequited attachment? Is
Miss Wetheral to become pointed at as a refused
and melancholy picture of disappointed love; or
is my lovely Clara to be your happy, affectionate
wife, Sir Foster Kerrison?" The lady's voice
sounded agitated and heart-broken at the conclusion
of her speech.</p>

<p>Sir Foster looked bewildered. He heard the
epithets "base" and "wicked," without comprehending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
their purport, or having a connecting
idea of the sentences which fell from Lady
Wetheral's lips with such voluble earnestness.
He only heard distinctly the concluding words,
"Is my lovely Clara to be your happy, affectionate
wife, Sir Foster?" and he replied with
quiet nonchalance,</p>

<p>"If you please&mdash;oh yes&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral smiled very complacently as
she rose from her seat.</p>

<p>"You have made me very happy, by proposing
for my Clara, dear Sir Foster, and we will
now return into the boudoir."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral talked all the way from the
drawing-room into her boudoir, while Sir Foster
followed, humming and staring, perfectly aware
something had happened, yet not quite awake
to its nature.</p>

<p>"I am delighted our little society is not to
be broken up, my dear Sir Foster: <i>now</i>, you
know, every thing will continue in its own
charming routine&mdash;you will be in your arm-chair
now every day, as a thing of course.
Sit down, dear Sir Foster; I will open this
window; the spring flowers are early and delicious
this season. I perceive Lucy and Clara
walking in the garden. Ah, I see you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
taken possession of your old seat, dear Sir
Foster."</p>

<p>Miss Kerrison and Clara were quickly at the
door of the boudoir. Clara had seen the signal;
the window was at last thrown open.</p>

<p>"Lucy, Lucy, your father is come; let us return
to the house," she cried, hastily retracing
her steps. Lucy followed instinctively.</p>

<p>"Lucy Kerrison," said Lady Wetheral, taking
her hand the moment she appeared, "I have very
extraordinary news for you! how are you inclined
to receive a mother-in-law, my dear love!"</p>

<p>"Are <i>you</i> going to marry papa?" asked Lucy
Kerrison, in extremity of surprise.</p>

<p>"No, my love; Sir John is in excellent health
in his study," replied her ladyship, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, how foolish! I forgot; but I fancied
you in earnest, and I could only think of yourself,
Lady Wetheral. Papa, are you going to
be married? Oh, don't marry! pray, don't
marry, papa, and I will return to Ripley with
you: but it's only a joke, is it papa?" and poor
Lucy Kerrison became very pale.</p>

<p>"My dear love, you really tremble; but I
assure you there is no need of any alarm. You
will not fear Clara as a new relation: you will
lead a very easy life with Clara, my dear Lucy!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Your papa has proposed for Clara, my dear
young friend. Are you sorry?"</p>

<p>Lucy Kerrison seated herself in perfect silence
and astonishment. Lady Wetheral resumed.</p>

<p>"Clara, my love, Sir Foster has decided upon
taking away my companion: he has asked for
you to ornament and enliven Ripley, my love.
How can I refuse Sir Foster Kerrison; and yet
how can I part with my only child, my only
companion, since the marriage of Mrs. Tom
Pynsent and Lady Ennismore!"</p>

<p>Miss Kerrison fixed her gaze upon Clara and
her father alternately, but she did not speak:
her ideas were too confused to admit of speech,
and she watched in stupid amazement the scene
that was passing before her. Lady Wetheral
approached Sir Foster, leading Clara.</p>

<p>"Rise, man of happy fortunes, and receive
the boon I tender to you according to your
wishes. Make my child happy, and I must reluctantly
consider myself fortunate in giving her
to a good, indulgent man, such as Sir Foster
Kerrison."</p>

<p>Sir Foster was noted for taciturnity, and inveterate
absence of mind, in society; but he was
not an absolute fool, and he was a great admirer
of beauty. He had a strong suspicion in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
mind that a young lady was on the point of
being forced upon him; but he hated altercation,
and the lady was young and particularly
handsome; besides, Lady Wetheral was insisting
upon it, he had made proposals, and it was useless
to contend. Sir Foster therefore rose and
bowed very gallantly&mdash;considering it was Sir
Foster; and that bow recognised and authorised
the whole affair. Lady Wetheral's care was
ended upon Clara's matrimonial prospects.</p>

<p>Miss Kerrison at length found words to express
her deep surprise, and indeed pleasure,
considering her father really meant to marry;
but she confessed the thing was a mystery to
her; she had seen no attention on her father's
part to Clara&mdash;never! As to his sitting three
hours every day at Wetheral, that was nothing&mdash;he
did so at many places. She never saw any
liking on Clara's part either&mdash;altogether, it was
the oddest piece of courtship she had ever seen
or read of.</p>

<p>Sir Foster having bowed and reseated himself,
heard all his daughter's remarks in silence. He
smiled and tapped his boot fast, which always
denoted concurrence, or was a symptom of
pleasure as far as it went; therefore, Miss Kerrison
continued.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sure, papa, you only visit here as you
did at Hatton and Lidham, and in Shrewsbury;
you never made love to Miss Wycherly or Miss
Spottiswoode; did you? And you never spoke
to, or looked at Clara that I could see? I cannot
make it all out! I am sure, Clara, you
would have mentioned it to me if you had liked
papa, or if you thought papa liked you. I
never shall understand it. Are you going to
marry soon, papa?"</p>

<p>"All in good time, my dear Lucy," replied
Lady Wetheral, pleased with the admirable issue
of her scheme; "there are many little things to
be done before Clara can be given up to you.
You, my dear Lucy, must be my daughter when
Clara goes to Ripley; you must stay with me
then, at poor lonely Wetheral."</p>

<p>"My dear Lady Wetheral, I will often come
to see you, but I am sure Clara will require my
assistance some time at Ripley. You don't
know how particular papa is in eating! Clara
will be some time finding out what papa likes,
and till then!&mdash;oh, Clara, till then!" Miss Kerrison
lifted up her hands and eyes. Sir Foster
only smiled at his daughter's insinuation; he
never offered to excuse or remove the implied
hint from the minds of his fair one, or her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
mother. Miss Kerrison proceeded with lively
energy,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Clara, I am very glad you mean to
marry papa, though I never shall understand
how it was brought about. I shall be released
from managing the establishment, which I do
not like. I hope you will get money from papa
for every thing; I can assure you I had dreadful
work to squeeze out a few pounds, and the fishmonger
is my abhorrence: papa and the fishmonger
have pretty scenes together!"</p>

<p>Sir Foster Kerrison chuckled, and winked his
eye with nervous rapidity.</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, you may laugh, but the fishmonger
did not. Do you know, Clara, papa
kicked the man and his basket of soles and
salmon out of the kitchen, and down the drive
at Ripley."</p>

<p>Another chuckle betrayed the delight Sir
Foster felt at the recollection of his prowess.
Lady Wetheral however thought it politic to
close the subject.</p>

<p>"Tradespeople are very tiresome, my dear
Lucy, and it requires a particular degree of patience
to deal with itinerant fish-people. I don't
wonder at your poor father losing temper. One
moment, my love, if you please."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>She rose and quitted the boudoir, followed by
Miss Kerrison, who accompanied her to the
breakfast-room. Her ladyship then expressed
and explained her wishes.</p>

<p>"My dear Lucy, it was time to have mercy
upon your father and his bride elect, therefore I
begged you to withdraw. They must have a
<i>tête-à-tête</i>, poor things, to explain their feelings
and inquire into each other's habits and tastes.
And now, my love, since events have unfolded
themselves so rapidly this morning, I must counsel
and advise with you. I think it prudent
that you should return to Ripley this morning,
Lucy; therefore the carriage shall be at your
service in two hours." Tears rushed into Lucy
Kerrison's eyes.</p>

<p>"You know, my dear love, a separation <i>now</i>
is merely a few hours' absence; something more
to smile at than weep over&mdash;perhaps a day or
two, not more. You are aware of your good
father's infirmity, Lucy; and I trust to your
good sense and kindness to remind him occasionally
of his engagement; you understand me,
my love."</p>

<p>"Yes, but papa forgets so sadly. After all,
he may go off, and sit three hours at Lidham
again; and how can I detain him, Lady Wetheral?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Circumstances are very different, my love!
Yet I do not say Sir Foster may not require a
little prompting <i>sometimes</i>; his absence of mind
is certainly a disease: perhaps, if you withheld
his cane, or concealed his coat&mdash;Pelham, you
know, might be let into the secret, to watch his
master; or, if you sent a message by him, to
freshen his recollection; but you will do every
thing well, I am sure, my love;&mdash;no one more
<i>au fait</i> and clever than Lucy Kerrison."</p>

<p>Thus flattered and counselled, Miss Kerrison
undertook to watch her father's whereabouts, and
Pelham was to be instructed to turn his master's
thoughts every morning to his regular ride towards
Wetheral. With these "advices" upon
her mind, poor Lucy was consigned to the carriage,
bearing with her many delightful compliments
and invitations to consider Wetheral her
second home&mdash;many pleasing anticipations of the
future&mdash;and much triumph that another was
going to undertake the management of Ripley,
her father's violence, and the frightful contests
between himself and the fishmonger.</p>

<p>Clara assured her mother, when Sir Foster had
departed, "that though the <i>tête-à-tête</i> had not
been a chatty affair, yet such taciturnity proved
a very quiet, mild character, which would suit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
her own warmth of temper. She was very content
to be Lady Kerrison, and have Lucy for a
companion. Sir Foster loved quiet, therefore he
would not interfere with her tastes, or quarrel
with her actions. She and Lucy would enjoy
themselves, and perhaps be a great deal from
home." Lady Wetheral quite acquiesced in
Clara's prognostics; there was only one little
affair to get over, and <i>that</i> would soften by time
and reason, she trusted.</p>

<p>"I mean your father's objection, my love; I
dare say he will be horrified at first, because he
fancies Sir Foster a little warm in his temper."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he is warm-tempered," replied
Clara, haughtily. "If I don't complain,
no one need make any objection."</p>

<p>"Exactly so, my love; who can possibly judge
of another's tastes? What I consider impetuous,
another person may think simply vivacious, and
so on. I think, my love, we will not say any
thing to your father just now; suppose we allow
the subject to remain in abeyance for a few days?
Sir John has such very narrow views of worldly
advantages; such peculiarly contracted notions
upon the luxuries of life."</p>

<p>Clara differed from Lady Wetheral. She considered
it better sense to state the circumstance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
at once to her father, since he must become a
principal in the affair sooner or later. She would
herself inform him of Sir Foster's proposal, and
if his objections were not to be reasoned with,
she must act for herself.</p>

<p>Such was Clara's determination, and such the
intrepidity of her temper at sixteen years of age.
Ungovernable in feeling, and haughty in disposition,
she held powerful sway over her mother's
mind; but it was yet to be proved whether her
father also would yield to her domineering and
intractable spirit. Lady Wetheral shrunk from
the combat which must ensue between parental
authority and filial disobedience; it would be a
combat far surpassing the skirmish which preceded
Lady Ennismore's engagement, for her
husband had seen the error of his frequent compliance
with her wishes, and his commands had
been peremptory in the matter of Sir Foster
Kerrison.</p>

<p>Clara's high spirit would not stoop to commit
her mother, by acknowledging her active management
in procuring the proposal, but it might
transpire that she had a deep share in its contrivance;
and she dreaded the calm bitterness of
her husband's reproaches. Clara's temper was
equal to a thousand storms, and a thousand untoward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
events: "Clara therefore must fight her
own battle; she was fully equipped for the war
of words which must ensue, and her lofty spirit
scorned the alarms which subjugated meaner and
more timid minds." Clara only smiled in contempt
at her mother's reasoning.</p>

<p>Sir John inquired at dinner what had become
of his young and agreeable friend Miss
Kerrison, who had so suddenly disappeared. His
lady's reply was perfectly satisfactory, and precluded
all further remark: "Miss Kerrison had
been summoned home by Sir Foster." The dinner
passed in harmony, and on Sir John's part,
with more than his usual vivacity. He seemed
to feel relieved by the absence of all associations
connected with Ripley. How little did he anticipate
the blow which awaited the withdrawal
of the servants, to fall heavily upon his heart!</p>

<p>Clara opened her subject with the indifference
of a person who had quite made up their mind
to all consequences, and dared every opposition;
she raised her wine-glass to sip its contents with
consummate nonchalance, and coolly commenced
her disclosure.</p>

<p>"Papa, I think it right to inform you of any
material step which I may take, therefore I beg
to tell you I have accepted Sir Foster Kerrison."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir John appeared for a moment stunned.
Clara resumed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Foster Kerrison pleases me; and, though
my tastes may clash with others, I alone am
judge of what will make me happy; therefore, I
have resolved to marry Sir Foster, papa."</p>

<p>Sir John's eyes were fixed upon his lady's face
in silence. She read their expression, and
shrunk under its deep meaning. A flood of tears
fortunately relieved the painful sense of self-upbraiding,
and proved a fruitful theme by which
to evade the subject so galling to her husband's
mind.</p>

<p>"Really, Sir John, I am so enfeebled by constant
flurry of mind, and my poor dear girls'
marriages, that a word or a look throws me into
fits of nervousness. I cannot imagine why you
should stare at me in that odd way, when I never
could endure a fixed gaze; particularly when
my spirits are low, and my nerves so shaken."</p>

<p>"Clara," said her father, calmly, "what events
have led to your acceptance of Sir Foster? when
did you accept him, and where have you met
him since your sisters' nuptials? Tell me candidly
how all this has happened."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, certainly, papa. Sir Foster has
been visiting me here some time."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never saw him, or heard of the visit, Clara,"
replied Sir John, mildly.</p>

<p>"You are always in your study, papa. People
seldom ask for you now," was Clara's observation,
as she helped herself to preserved strawberries
with perfect coolness of manner.</p>

<p>"Gertrude," said Sir John, "you have concealed
all this from me, and disobeyed my strong
injunctions to allow no intimacy with Sir Foster
Kerrison. Since my wife persists in opposing
me, I cannot be surprised at a child defying me."</p>

<p>"I never asked Sir Foster to Wetheral,"
faltered the lady; "his visits were not the consequences
of any invitation from me; you have
never seen him here, my love: I never ventured
to ask him to dinner: I never held out an inducement
to attract him here. It has been Sir
Foster's own act and deed to propose to my
daughter; and his calling occasionally was very
natural, while Lucy staid with us. You brought
him in yourself one day; but really all this violent
altercation destroys my nerves, and undermines
my health." Lady Wetheral sunk back in
her chair, closed her eyes, and applied her
vinaigrette.</p>

<p>Sir John was silent for some moments, as if
his thoughts and feelings were too powerful to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
produce utterance. Clara did not, or would
not, perceive his emotion; she continued eating
her biscuit and strawberries with calm unconcern,
not at all disconcerted by the deep silence
which followed her mother's speech. Sir John at
length rose, and, with great solemnity of tone and
manner, addressed his youngest daughter, who
was seated a silent spectator of the whole scene.</p>

<p>"Chrystal, it is time for me to take some steps
towards removing you from such examples. I
shall accompany you to Brierly to-morrow, and
place you, for the present, under Boscawen's
care. He will take charge of you till I can
claim you in peace. When I have deposited you
in safety, I shall remove from Wetheral for ever.
Your mother and sister will accompany me into
Scotland, as I shall reside in future at Fairlee."</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed Lady Wetheral's terror
at these words, spoken so calmly and so decidedly.
She rushed towards her husband, and
seized his arm with nervous trepidation.</p>

<p>"Don't go into Scotland, John! oh, don't go
there, to horrid Fairlee! I shall die there&mdash;no,
no; say you will not take me from Wetheral,
and I will promise any thing, John!" Her ladyship's
alarm became very powerful, and she sank
to the ground. Christobelle would have flown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to the bell to summon Thompson, but her father
forbade the action; he begged that such scenes
might never be disclosed to the eyes of the household.
He raised her, and laid her on a sofa, but
it was some time ere her senses returned. She
wandered evidently for some hours in her conversation,
and was at length placed in bed, under
the influence of a powerful narcotic. Christobelle
watched by her as she slept.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral felt all this most painfully;
but he was now awake to the weakness of his
conduct in placing such implicit confidence in
his lady's system of education; he felt too late
how indolently he had succumbed to her tears and
reproaches against his own better judgment,
even to the sacrifice of Julia; and now he was
resolved to save Clara, at the risk of sacrificing
for ever all future hopes of domestic felicity. Her
ladyship's fearful apprehensions of Fairlee threatened
an illness: but Sir John was firmly resolved
to quit Shropshire; to leave at once the scene
of deception which irritated his mind; to save,
if possible, the fate which awaited Clara, should
her evil genius give her into the power of Sir
Foster Kerrison.</p>

<p>Christobelle was still watching in her mother's
room, when she opened her eyes, and faintly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
called for Thompson. Christobelle did not reply,
but walked softly to the side of her bed, to
inquire how she felt after her long sleep. Her
eyes were heavy, for she closed them as she
spoke.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Thompson? I have had such
horrible dreams: your master is going into
Scotland, and poor Miss Clara will be taken
away from Sir Foster, after all my trouble."</p>

<p>"It is me, mamma," whispered Christobelle.</p>

<p>"Well, well," replied her mother, petulantly,
"never mind who it is, you are equally included
in this dreadful Fairlee business. I shall never
live to reach Scotland: the dullness of the place&mdash;no
neighbourhood&mdash;all old married men&mdash;not
a match there fit for Clara&mdash;altogether it will
kill me."</p>

<p>A silence of some moments ensued, and she
spoke again in low complaining tones.</p>

<p>"Your poor father's violence has made me
seriously ill, Bell, and he must lay my death at
his own door. Sir Foster has been extremely ill
used, and all the neighbourhood will think so,
after his proposal being accepted, and his attachment
made so public! My poor child Clara!
it is very cruel by her, and the affair has broken
my heart."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>There was again a pause, so continued, that
Christobelle believed her mother slept; at last
she heard her name pronounced.</p>

<p>"Bell."</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, I am close to you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Bell, as you have influence with
your father, you can find out his intentions with
respect to Sir Foster. I can't think he would
break off such a match, but I am too unwell to
enter upon the subject with him now. Go down,
Bell, and manage your father, as I used to do,
only bring me some intelligence."</p>

<p>"Shall I ask the question for you, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Don't be stupid, Bell; ask questions? Nonsense!
You will never get the truth from man
by a direct question, foolish child. You know
what I mean; now go and glean his intentions
with cleverness; it will be practice for you;
there, no reply, Bell; no sentimentality; I detest
it!"</p>

<p>Christobelle left the room, not quite comprehending
her mother's words. She could not understand
the "gleaning," neither did she know
the meaning of the word "sentimentality," but
she went to her father's study, and found him in
his arm-chair, the candles standing before him
unsnuffed. It was nearly twelve o'clock when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
she entered. Her father held out his hand, and
drew her to him.</p>

<p>"You are still up, my child, and it is very
late."</p>

<p>She told him her mother had slept long, and
was very anxious to know whether he really intended
to quit Wetheral.</p>

<p>"Your mamma sent you to inquire, my love?"</p>

<p>She hesitated. "No, papa, not to inquire;
mamma forbade my asking questions."</p>

<p>"What <i>were</i> you to do, then, Chrystal, since
your mother wished to know my sentiments?"</p>

<p>Christobelle hesitated again. She was not prepared
for this close investigation.</p>

<p>"Chrystal, whenever you speak, let it be
strictly in truth, and with open-heartedness;
God and your father, my child, hate insincerity,
and untrue lips; speak without fear, and without
evasion. What is this all about?"</p>

<p>Christobelle became alarmed at her father's
grave observation, and lost all presence of mind;
she repeated at once her mother's injunction.</p>

<p>"Papa, I was told to glean your intentions,
without sentimentality, that was all; only I
don't know what 'glean' means."</p>

<p>"Go to bed, now, my dear child, and I will
visit your mother," said her father, in a melancholy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
tone of voice, which surprised her. "You
and I have a journey before us, Chrystal; the
day after to-morrow we shall set out for Brierly;
you will be useful to Isabel, and improved by
Boscawen's society and tastes. Good night, and
go to your bed, my love."</p>

<p>She went to her room, and slept soundly, innocent
of wrong, and ignorant of the scene which
took place in her mother's room, in consequence
of her unfortunate disclosure. Christobelle was
summoned to Lady Wetheral's bed-side after
breakfast; Clara was seated reading near the
window, and a small table covered with essence-bottles
told her at a glance there had been strife.
Christobelle was accosted with much irony.</p>

<p>"Peacemakers are desirable people, Bell, and,
doubtless, your heart is enjoying the harmony
you have created; pray advance, and behold
your delightful work. Am I quite as miserable
as you wish, Christobelle? or have you any little
poisoned arrow to apply, by way of completing
my distress? Pray do me the honour to inform
me what my next annoyance shall be!"</p>

<p>Christobelle stood in astonishment; her mother
was very seldom bitter in her remarks.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are not aware you have procured
the dismissal of Sir Foster Kerrison, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
may, probably, be the cause of your sister taking
strong steps to assert herself. I suppose you
are not aware you have made her and myself
wretched, by your stupid matter of fact!"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral laid down her salts bottle, and
took up the vinaigrette; Christobelle could only
weep, and plead ignorance of all intention of
offending.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no help, now," continued her
mother, changing her tone, and resuming the
language of complaint. "You have done mischief,
and you must endeavour to repair it.
Your father intends to see Sir Foster to-day, and
I am too ill to interfere; he will be violent, I
dare say, for he has quite changed his nature,
and his violence to me lately has been extraordinary;
I know he will forget himself, and
offend Sir Foster. Now, Bell, you must manage
to place a slip of paper in Sir Foster's hand as
he leaves the room, and do not make such mistakes
as you generally contrive to do with your
horrible matter of fact ways."</p>

<p>"There is no occasion for any slip of paper,"
observed Clara, without raising her eyes from
the book she held before her.</p>

<p>"My dear Clara, yes!" said her mother, in an
earnest tone.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"I choose to manage my own affairs," was
Clara's quiet reply.</p>

<p>"But, my love, my dear Clara, remember Sir
Foster's wretched memory! he requires some
management!"</p>

<p>"I shall attend to all that is necessary," replied
Clara.</p>

<p>"Well, my love, I ask no questions; indeed,
I have no wish to interfere; I have done all <i>I</i>
could do, in bringing Sir Foster to propose, and
you must guard your own property now. I ask
no questions; we will ask no questions, Bell;
we will not be curious. I have neither eyes nor
ears, Clara; I have only sunny thoughts, bright
visions of Lady Kerrison presiding at Ripley, in
spite of appearances; but, Bell, you must be
blind: with all your might, remember; no more
mistakes, if you please, and you may be of some
use; you are too old to affect ignorance now,
and I cannot excuse it."</p>

<p>Christobelle was in a tremor; for the sentences
which flowed in such profusion from her mother's
lips, conveyed no meaning to her mind; she
was anxious to do right, but no distinct line of
conduct had been pointed out; she told her mother
steadily, yet in considerable alarm, that she
did not know what was meant.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"I dare say not, Bell; your ideas are as
limited as your poor father's, and I can imagine
your influence over his mind must be very extensive&mdash;the
confluence of dullness and stupidity.
However, Bell, you can, probably, comprehend
what I mean, when I command you to keep all
you see and hear to yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, I can do that."</p>

<p>"Very well. If you find Sir Foster Kerrison
at any time about the premises, don't see him;
and, whatever may take place around you, be
ignorant of all things. Can you do this?"</p>

<p>"I will not say any thing to papa, unless he
asks a question," replied Christobelle, quite assured
in mind that she was giving satisfaction at
last; her mother did not join her in opinion.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, folly! you have not common
sense to guide you through life, child. Thank
Heaven, the burden of procuring <i>you</i> an establishment
will not be upon my shoulders! Your
father must manage that affair as he pleases; he
takes the whole management of you upon himself.
Your wretched matter-of-fact ways would
traverse all my plans for your benefit."</p>

<p>Christobelle was wrong again! She never
could understand her mother's innuendoes, and
she told her so, though she trembled as the words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
fell hesitating from her lips. She told her, also,
that she could not comprehend the epithet
"matter-of-fact," which she continually used
with reference to her conduct. Alas! the explanation
was to the artless girl equally unintelligible.</p>

<p>"You have no capacity, Bell, or you would
understand the meaning of that expression.
Your sisters were not matter-of-fact, unless,
perhaps, Mrs. Tom Pynsent might be considered
so; but time would have improved her; <i>you</i> are
past hope. Nothing is so matter-of-fact, as believing
every thing you hear, and answering
questions point-blank. Nothing can be so cruelly
matter-of-fact, as telling people exactly what
you think, and making remarks upon people's
movements. I believe matter-of-fact is born
with you, and I can perceive no intuition, no
tact in your manners, by which to imagine a
germ might be fostered by practice. You will
be very like your grand aunt, Bell, and like her,
too, you will live single. I have no hopes from
such mental poverty."</p>

<p>Clara appeared absorbed in her book, for she
never raised her eyes, or joined in the conversation
which related to her sister. After her
haughtily expressed determination to be guided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
by her own judgment, she remained silent, nor
did she apparently hear a word that passed between
her mother and Christobelle. Time was,
certainly, fostering the "germ" of resolution
in Clara's breast; and now that circumstances
and events developed her character, it was easy
to see she had shaken off all restraints, and intended
to hold the reins in her own youthful and
inexperienced hands. Lady Wetheral felt her
power was no more, if it had ever existed, over
Clara's opinions and conduct; and she detained
her youngest daughter to listen to her grievances.</p>

<p>"Altogether, Bell, what with your dullness,
and Clara's temper, I have never been happy
since your sisters married. I have endured a
great deal from your father's violence, too,
lately; last night he was indescribably violent,
and I am sinking into ill-health. He is resolved
Clara shall not be Lady Kerrison, and he has
ordered the poor dear man to be shown into the
study when he calls to-day. Do be there, Bell,
and report the whole affair; you surely have
just capacity for that?"</p>

<p>"Report <i>nothing</i>," said Clara, without raising
her eyes from her book.</p>

<p>"My dear Clara, you really shock me!" Her
mother laid down her vinaigrette, and took up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the eau-de-luce. "My dear girl, you frighten
me with such abrupt and alarming sentences.
Do you not intend to marry Sir Foster Kerrison?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," replied Clara, haughtily.</p>

<p>"Then, my love, why do you forbid Bell reporting
his interview with your father?"</p>

<p>"I hate all that nonsense and tale-bearing;
let Bell alone; why is she to be taught eavesdropping?"</p>

<p>"Really, Clara, you are becoming quite harsh.
I certainly never taught any of you to do wrong,
unless procuring the best alliances for you all is
considered an injury. I cannot approve your
remark, my dear love, at all."</p>

<p>Miss Wetheral did not reply.</p>

<p>"I cannot make out Clara's temper, Bell,"
whispered her mother, "there is nothing to be
<i>got at</i> in her; I never can have any influence,
when I particularly wish to point her attention
to circumstances; however, I must let her take
her own way, for she means to marry Sir Foster,
I see, and my mind is fixed upon that match.
Well, I shall rise, now, but I am seriously ill
from your father's imperious conduct last night."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, mamma."</p>

<p>"Sorry! Yes, it was your stupid folly which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
caused such an unprovoked attack. When Clara
marries, I shall visit my dear Julia: her situation,
so exalted, and the novelty of a new neighbourhood,
will amuse me. You can take care
of Sir John while I am absent. Perhaps, Bell,
I may see some young man who may do for you
some six years hence."</p>

<p>"No, I thank you, mamma."</p>

<p>"Oh, do not be alarmed," exclaimed Lady
Wetheral, a little indignantly, "I am not going
to trouble myself about your fortunes. You can
return to the study: don't tumble over the
chairs, Bell. You are at that awkward, ugly age,
all legs and wings&mdash;there, get you gone."</p>

<p>Christobelle was very well pleased to escape,
for she ever dreaded a summons to her mother's
apartments. She might be awkward, and her
countenance might be displeasing, but her father
never alluded to personal appearance. His voice
breathed accents of kindness and affection, and
he only taught her to be good and dutiful. To
his study she retired, as to the home of her happiness,
and she was there when Sir Foster Kerrison
was announced, according to Sir John's
orders. Lucy Kerrison had kept her word&mdash;she
had indeed reminded her father of his <i>devoir</i> at
Wetheral Castle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Foster stood somewhat bewildered, at his
entrance: he had been marshalled to the right
instead of the left, upon alighting, and he was
now ushered into a large room filled with books,
instead of work-baskets and ladies. Altogether,
without the trouble of reasoning upon the matter,
or exactly perceiving how things were, Sir
Foster felt something was different from what it
had been: the chain of daily events at Wetheral
was broken; he had got into a different line of
action, without knowing why, or how it had been
effected. Sir Foster's embarrassment, however,
was only perceived in the nervous motion of his
eye, and the tapping of his boot; for, in despite
of the unhappy absence of mind, which indolence
had nurtured, and which ever produced ridicule,
his manners were those of an eccentric but polite
man.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral received him with gravity,
but with kindness, and, after a few observations
had passed upon the state of crops and the
weather, he commenced the subject near his
heart. Sir Foster sat in silent reverie while Sir
John poured forth his regret at an engagement
having been entered into with his daughter without
his concurrence; he spoke feelingly upon the
deception which had surrounded that engagement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and expressed his entire disapproval of
the match. Sir Foster smiled and winked, as
allusion was made to the known violence of his
temper; and he tapped his boot with rapid
strokes, when Sir John professed his more powerful
objections arose from his constant absence
at the house of prayer.&mdash;"If," he said, "a man
cared not to pray to his Maker, he would never
heed the happiness of a creature committed to
his care; and he would rather follow his child to
the grave, than give her to a man who had no
respect to earthly or heavenly things&mdash;whose
passions were violent, and whose faith was unsettled."</p>

<p>Sir Foster had nothing to say in extenuation,
if he really understood the purport of the address;
but he looked perfectly innocent of all charges,
or of having attached any meaning to the sounds
which reached his ear. Sir John remembered
Sir Foster's besetting sin, and accosted him
again with decision, as Lady Wetheral had done
in a similar situation, though upon a different
subject.</p>

<p>"Sir Foster, I forbid your visits to my daughter
Clara."</p>

<p>Sir Foster raised his eyebrows, but he understood
the sentence: it was clear and concise.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eh?&mdash;yes, certainly, if Lady Wetheral does
not mind."</p>

<p>"I am afraid, sir, Lady Wetheral has given
you encouragement in this affair."</p>

<p>"Umph!&mdash;ah!&mdash;yes; something of that sort."</p>

<p>"I must insist upon ending the engagement,
Sir Foster."</p>

<p>"Eh!&mdash;what? Yes, if you like."</p>

<p>There was a silence for some moments; it was
broken by Sir Foster, in apparently complete
forgetfulness of the preceding subject.</p>

<p>"Boscawen keep his blood mare?"</p>

<p>Sir John smiled, as he replied in the affirmative.
Sir Foster began to wink his eye violently.</p>

<p>"Give him two hundred for her."</p>

<p>Sir John mentioned his intended visit to
Brierly, and offered to be the bearer of his message
or intentions.</p>

<p>"Go with you."</p>

<p>"Ripley does not lie far out of our way; shall
I call for you, Sir Foster? We shall be happy
to offer you a seat in or outside the carriage,
which you please."</p>

<p>Sir Foster smiled and hummed, which, according
to Lucy Kerrison's reading, implied consent;
they were therefore to have the pleasure of his
company on their journey. Sir John would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
feel annoyed by the accession of a taciturn companion;
Sir Foster would, at least, be out of
Clara's neighbourhood, and, what was more satisfactory,
he would be beyond the reach of his
lady's machinations.</p>

<p>After this arrangement, Sir Foster remained
two hours, silently smiling in his chair, without
changing his position, or appearing to feel the
absence of his so lately affianced bride. Once
initiated in another suite of apartments, it was
more than likely he would, in future, seek the
study as naturally as he had made his <i>sederunt</i>
in the boudoir; but the proposed journey must
interfere with his plans, and force them into
other channels. Brierly and the blood-mare had
present possession of his memory, and, unless
they sank into the oblivious depths of his lethargic
mind, Sir Foster was destined to become a
millstone round the energies of Mr. Boscawen,
and Clara must relinquish all hope of securing
her fleeting lover.</p>

<p>Sir John was aware of his companion's eccentric
habits, therefore his studies were quietly
resumed, and Sir Foster was allowed to smile and
doze out his allotted time in his own peculiar
way. Happiness is very differently defined by
individuals: Sir Foster considered it enjoyed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
a long course of half-dreamy nothingness, seated
in a soft arm-chair, tapping his boot, and not
bored by questions or remarks: Mrs. Hancock
and Mrs. Pynsent loved locomotion, and considered
life given as a means of enjoyment in talking,
walking, driving, laughing, and "fun:" Sir
John Wetheral loved retirement with books:
his lady confessed she delighted in matchmaking,
and visiting different watering-places: yet do we
know and feel happiness is not of this world;
and our enjoyments prove, in the end, the highway
to trials and cares.</p>

<p>Sir Foster Kerrison, at length, awoke from his
long calm, and put on his hat. Christobelle was
reading aloud to her father, but she became silent
at this moment, which denoted preparation for
departure. Sir Foster did not observe this;
probably he did not see them, for he rose humming
an air, and, winking very nervously, looked
attentively at a portrait of "Eclipse," and walked
deliberately out of the study. This was Sir Foster's
"odd way," and no one ever took offence
at any thing Sir Foster did or said. Sir John
only remarked, in his gentle way, "Clara's idea
of Sir Foster's temper may not coincide with
mine&mdash;a young girl cannot understand how
deeply her husband's temper may implicate her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
happiness&mdash;but I am astonished at her taste, in
selecting a man whose manners must disgust a
delicate woman, and who has already forgotten
his dismissal, in anxiety to purchase a blood-mare
at Brierly. I fear Clara is dazzled by motives
which blind her to truth. I will take you to
Brierly, my love, to-morrow: I long to get you
away from this place."</p>

<p>When Christobelle passed through the chapel
to reach her own room, she saw Clara and Sir
Foster Kerrison walking in the avenue: she
could not be mistaken; the chapel-window commanded
the avenue, and Clara was seen distinctly.
She appeared in very earnest conversation:
Sir Foster led his horse by the bridle-rein,
and Christobelle thought one arm was round
Clara's waist. She remembered her mother's
injunction "not to see" Sir Foster if she met
him upon the premises; and she obeyed the
spirit of her meaning, for she made no observation
respecting what she had seen. Clara appeared
at dinner perfectly calm and collected,
and her spirits were higher than usual: she had
not the pale cheek, or monumental look, which
Shakespeare describes so pathetically&mdash;there was
no sign that<br /></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He she loved proved false, and did forsake her."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>All was tranquil health and untamed spirits in
Clara's beautiful face. Christobelle persuaded
herself she could <i>not</i> have seen her sister in the
avenue, and that she was yet ignorant of Sir Foster's
intention to accompany them to Brierly,
and bid high for the blood-mare. When the
family separated for the night, Lady Wetheral
coolly wished her youngest daughter a happy
meeting with her friends at Brierly: she should
not be up, and begged Christobelle would not
rattle at her door with her awkward fingers, under
pretence of leave-taking. She was to give
her love to Mrs. Boscawen, and bid her remember
the baize-door for the nursery.</p>

<p>Clara advanced and kissed her sister: she
spoke laughingly.</p>

<p>"You need not visit my room, Bell, to-morrow,
because I shall be very busy; but I wish
you lots of happiness, if there is such material
at Brierly. How long do you remain?"</p>

<p>"Papa says, till you are all at Fairlee."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, a happy meeting to us all at
Fairlee; but, Bell, before we meet again,<br /></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'I'm o'er the border, and awa'<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Wi' Jock o' Hasledean!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"You don't understand me? Never mind&mdash;I don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
think I shall like Fairlee. How you stare, Miss
Bell!"</p>

<p>Christobelle did look surprised: she could not
understand Clara's gaiety upon her lover's dismissal.
She retired to her room, however, and
lost all recollections, in deep and sweet slumber,
both of the past and present.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p>Sir John Wetheral and Christobelle were
speedily on their road to Ripley. The morning
air was fresh and delicious, for May was on its
threshold, and April had passed in smiles. The
father's countenance beamed with pleasure, for
he was conferring happiness&mdash;and his daughter
was revelling in delight, because she was rolling
towards Isabel, and should enjoy hours of amusement
with the kind and patient Mr. Boscawen.
All nature smiled under her eager eye, and she
fancied the woods of Ripley even more beautiful
than the grounds of Wetheral. They turned
from the high road, through the great gates of
Ripley Park, and wound for nearly two miles by
the side of a lake, magnificent in her estimation
at that time, and lovely in its stillness, now.
The grey towers of Ripley burst upon the sight,
as they turned rapidly from the beautiful sheet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of water to enter the deep shrubbery which led
to its entrance, and Christobelle could not help
exclaiming&mdash;"Oh, papa, how beautiful this is!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Christobelle, it is lovely; and all, save
the spirit of man, is divine," replied her father,
patting her shoulder.</p>

<p>"That was a quotation, papa, from Lord Byron,
which you read to me yesterday. Oh, see
what a collection of beautiful plants are ranged
in the conservatory!"</p>

<p>Christobelle was engrossed with the sight of
the numerous flowering shrubs, when the carriage
stopped, and four servants advanced to the
hall-door. Sir John inquired if their master was
at home.</p>

<p>Sir Foster had been from home since half-past
five o'clock that morning.</p>

<p>"When was he expected to return?"</p>

<p>Sir Foster had left no orders or directions.</p>

<p>"Surely," said Sir John, "Sir Foster has forgotten
our engagement, and has set off to Brierly
alone. Is Miss Kerrison at home?"</p>

<p>Miss Kerrison was walking in the park&mdash;should
they send her information of Sir John
Wetheral's arrival?</p>

<p>"By no means. Sir Foster is probably gone
to Brierly; but, if your master returns from elsewhere,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
inform him I am on the road to Bridgnorth."
Sir John ordered the postillions to proceed.</p>

<p>They drove back, towards the park gates, and
met Miss Kerrison, at the head of her little troop
of brothers and sisters. The carriage stopped at
their approach, and Lucy Kerrison's eyes sparkled
with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Are you come for <i>me</i>, Sir John? Has Lady
Wetheral sent for <i>me</i>, by your early visit?"</p>

<p>The expression of her face clouded over, when
she learned their destination; but she could not
enlighten her friends upon Sir Foster's flight.
Lucy said, "her father did such odd things,
that no one at Ripley ever knew where he was.
Sometimes he was here, and sometimes he was
there&mdash;he had left the house very early, which
was rather an event of novelty, as he seldom rose
before eleven; but she was sure her father did
not know himself where he was going, and no
one else could guess." With this unsatisfactory
intelligence, Sir John and Christobelle were
obliged to take leave of Miss Kerrison, and
pursue their route. Sir John persisted in supposing
Sir Foster far on his way towards Brierly.
Christobelle, on the other hand, felt an
undefinable assurance that he was gone to visit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Clara. The subject, however, faded soon from
the mind of each; and Sir John cheered the
remainder of the drive, by pleasant tales, and
affectionate questionings upon subjects they had
read together.</p>

<p>Isabel screamed with joy at her father and
sister's arrival. She was walking up and down
before their door, holding her husband's arm,
when the carriage suddenly appeared before
them. She rushed to the door, ere the servant
could open it, and threw herself into her father's
arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, what a blessing this is! What
made you think of coming to see us so soon?
and pray let Chrystal remain with me for some
months, now she is here. Oh, papa, this is such
a happiness! such a comfort!" Isabel threw
her arms round her sister's neck, and wept.</p>

<p>"Well, Chrystal, you see I am crying; but
it's for joy to see you both at Brierly. I hope
you will stay a long time! My dear papa, come
in, and refresh yourself before dinner;&mdash;and,
Chrystal, you will be such a dear companion to
me!"</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen waited till the raptures were
ended, and then he welcomed them to Brierly,
with the kindness which ever made him agreeable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to those he esteemed. The meeting on all
sides was most delightful in feeling, and they
entered the house, full of smiles and mutual
content. Isabel stood for a moment in the hall,
and looked at her husband.</p>

<p>"Mr. Boscawen, I am going to take my sister
up stairs, into my room&mdash;is that right?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my love, do so; the half-hour
bell will ring in a few minutes."</p>

<p>Isabel seated herself, when they had gained her
dressing-room, and drew a chair for her sister.</p>

<p>"Now, Chrystal, just take off your hat and
shake your curls." Christobelle did so.</p>

<p>"Very well; now you are ready for dinner,
so let us chat out the time till the bell rings, and
tell me all about Wetheral. Poor Wetheral!&mdash;I
often wish I was there again. Oh, Chrystal,
perhaps now you are arrived, I shall not be so
much with Miss Tabitha, work, work, work, all
day long!&mdash;but what brought you here, without
any notice? I hope every body is well?"</p>

<p>Christobelle gave her sister all the Wetheral
news, and detailed the affairs of Clara as clearly
as her young judgment would allow. Isabel was
charmed.</p>

<p>"Well, papa was so good to prevent Clara
marrying that old Sir Foster! I assure you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Chrystal, it would have been a foolish affair.
How would poor Clara have endured reading
four or five hours every day, per force, with her
warm temper?"</p>

<p>"Sir Foster never reads, Isabel."</p>

<p>"Ah, but he would have compelled her to
read; for old men are all alike, Chrystal. You
may depend upon it, Clara would have been
miserable. Is Sir Foster very unhappy about
it?"</p>

<p>Christobelle told her in confidence what she
had seen as she passed through the chapel, and
how cheerful Clara appeared afterwards at dinner.
Isabel looked serious.</p>

<p>"What could that mean? I was very unhappy,
I know, till papa said I should marry
Mr. Boscawen. I was very silly, then; but Clara
was not Lady Kerrison, therefore she did not
know how very soon those things are got over,
and I am surprised she was cheerful just at that
time. I wonder any body marries so young,
when they can do as they please at home. Don't
marry, Chrystal, till you are thirty."</p>

<p>The great gong sounded at this moment, and
Isabel rose to make a change in her dress: but
she continued talking.</p>

<p>"I don't mind that horrible gong, to-day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
because you and papa are here; but it is always
a signal to me of misery. After the gong sounds,
I am sure to pass the remainder of the day with
Miss Tabitha, and I am tired to death with teaching.
In the morning I am learning geography and
history, and the evening brings tent-stitch and
lectures. I hope I shan't be obliged to learn
tent-stitch while you are here."</p>

<p>Isabel's maid appeared, to assist her mistress.</p>

<p>"Oh, is that you, Mrs. Anson? Do you know
if Mr. Boscawen has ordered any change in the
dinner? I am sure I forgot all about it. Dear
me, Anson, how hot your hands are! Well, if
ever I felt such hands! Mr. Boscawen's hands
are cold as ice. Just scratch out my hair, Anson.
I don't care how it looks; no more will
Clara, if she marries Sir.... There is Mr. Boscawen's
tap against the wall; don't you hear
it? Now that tap always means that he is ready
to go down, and I must hold my tongue and
make haste. I am always chatting to Mrs. Anson,
when you are not here, Chrystal. Come, I
am ready now."</p>

<p>They left the dressing-room, and Mr. Boscawen
appeared immediately at his door. He
offered an arm to each, and they descended to
the drawing-room, where Sir John was seated in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
company with Miss Boscawen, who was diligently
plying at a large worstedwork frame,
dressed in dove-coloured silk, the whitest muslin
handkerchief, and the most delicate net-cap
which had ever gladdened the eye: she was indeed
the <i>beau ideal</i> of an old maid. Christobelle
looked with pleased astonishment at the delicate
cleanliness of her person; the band of brown
hair, intermingled with grey, which peeped beneath
her cap&mdash;the tightly-fitting dress&mdash;her
white silk mittens&mdash;the repose of her countenance,
which looked smilingly upon her&mdash;all inclined
Christobelle to admire and gaze upon Miss
Tabitha Boscawen. Surely, this could not be
the original of Isabel's gloomy description!</p>

<p>Christobelle's admiration amused and pleased
Miss Boscawen: she rose, and held out her hand.
"You are welcome," she said, "to Brierly, Miss
Wetheral. Our dear Isabel will be delighted to
have a companion in her work and studies."</p>

<p>Christobelle was charmed by the reception,
and stood near Miss Boscawen, examining her
work, and watching its progress. She was
pleased by her young acquaintance's curiosity,
for she performed her stitches very slowly, to
allow time for observation. She asked Christobelle
if she loved work: Christobelle told her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
she should like to learn to work well, but that
she was very fond of reading. She smiled.</p>

<p>"I shall be happy to teach you every kind of
stitch, Miss Wetheral, when you are tired with
books. I like to see young people employed.
Every hour is valuable, and idleness is the mother
of mischief, as you may remember writing in your
copybook. I hope you are never idle, Miss
Wetheral?"</p>

<p>Isabel answered for her sister.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear Tabitha, Chrystal is always reading
history and poetry: I am astonished at her learning,
for I never could bear reading or writing:
I liked my doll best, and dancing with Tom
Pynsent."</p>

<p>"We shall like one another, Miss Wetheral, I
foresee," said Miss Boscawen, taking no notice
of the latter part of Isabel's speech.</p>

<p>At dinner, Isabel sat silent. She took her
seat at the head of the table, it is true; but her
eyes were constantly referring to her husband,
and sundry whispers from Miss Boscawen, who
sat at her right hand, increased her alarm and
confusion. There were some attractive glasses
of raspberry-cream upon the table at the second
course, to which Isabel "did seriously incline,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and she accordingly had one placed before her.
Miss Boscawen was distressed.</p>

<p>"Oh! sister, that is the worst thing you could
eat at this time! Pray send away that cream!
John, take away that cream!"</p>

<p>Isabel's eyes overflowed, as the cream vanished
from her sight: Mr. Boscawen saw her disappointment
with pity, and endeavoured to mitigate
the sentence.</p>

<p>"Tabitha, <i>half</i> a cream will not hurt Isabel:
let her try half a cream."</p>

<p>"Oh, brother, the very worst thing my sister
could take! No, don't eat a cream, sister."</p>

<p>"I think," said Sir John, "as the parent of
five children, I will undertake to answer for the
innocence of the cream. Lady Wetheral fancied
many extraordinary things, and did not suffer
from their effects. I should be inclined to give
Isabel that cream, Boscawen."</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen appeared pleased by an opinion
of some weight and experience, which coincided
with his own wish to gratify his young wife: he
accordingly ordered the cream to be reinstated
on her plate. Isabel ate of it greedily.</p>

<p>"Oh, brother!" exclaimed Miss Boscawen,
"sister will be so ill!"</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen, however, enjoyed the eagerness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and satisfaction with which Isabel devoured
her cream. "Poor thing, poor thing!" he uttered,
in a low tone, as Isabel laid down her spoon, and
exclaimed, "How excellently good that was!"</p>

<p>"It will do you no harm, my love," said her
father, as he watched her with great interest;
"I will answer for your not suffering any unpleasant
effects."</p>

<p>"Oh! Sir John," exclaimed Miss Boscawen,
"creams are such very indigestible things! I
am sure sister will be very poorly; indeed, brother,
sister will be ill."</p>

<p>Christobelle now understood the meaning of
poor Isabel's distress, when she complained at
Wetheral, that only Miss Tabitha was to preside
over her confinement. Miss Boscawen did indeed
watch over her with jealous care, and, like
Don Pedro Snatchaway in Sancho's suite, she
allowed her victim neither to eat nor drink in
peace. When the ladies retired from the dining-room,
Miss Boscawen fidgeted about Isabel's
seat. She was not to sit near the window&mdash;it
was cold; she was not to sit near the fire&mdash;it
was hot: the sofa was not quite the thing, and
the chairs might make her uncomfortable. Poor
Isabel looked at her sister in despair.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Boscawen was equally alarmed when
Isabel offered to walk round the flower-garden
with Christobelle.</p>

<p>"Oh! sister, the sun is setting, and you will
take such a cold! you have eaten a cream; pray
don't take cold upon it."</p>

<p>The walk was given up; Isabel would chat
about Wetheral.</p>

<p>"Now, sister, don't talk much just after your
dinner; nothing does so much harm to the constitution,
and so completely prevents digestion."</p>

<p>Well, then, they would all take a little nap.</p>

<p>"Won't you get very fat, sister?" asked Miss
Boscawen, as she saw Isabel preparing to lie
down upon the sofa; "sleep fattens very much."</p>

<p>Isabel, however, made her preparations, and
composed herself to sleep. Christobelle sat by
her with a book which she had taken from one
of the tables. Miss Boscawen sat down to her
worsted frame, and rang for candles. They were
some time silent, when Isabel started up and exclaimed
she was extremely unwell. Miss Boscawen
looked horrified.</p>

<p>"Oh! sister, that cream! I knew you would
be ill."</p>

<p>"I cannot tell the reason, but I am very ill.
Send for Mr. Boscawen, Chrystal." Isabel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
looked very pale, and was unable to rise from
the sofa.</p>

<p>"Oh! sister, don't send for my brother; let
me assist you to your room; the cream has
made you sick."</p>

<p>"Send for Mr. Boscawen," repeated Isabel,
her face becoming flushed with pain.</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen was summoned, and he carried
Isabel to her bed. The surprise and joy of receiving
her family unexpectedly, had brought on
a rather premature confinement. The medical
man was sent for, the nurse was summoned in
haste; all the household were in commotion.
The medical attendant gave it as his opinion
some surprise or alarm had hastened Mrs. Boscawen's
accouchement. Miss Boscawen was
convinced it was the raspberry-cream.</p>

<p>Sir John decided to remain at Brierly, till
Isabel should be considered out of all danger,
and till the little stranger should receive his
blessing. All that night passed in eager hope
and watching. Christobelle could not sleep;
she could not rest in her bed, but remained at
Isabel's door, listening to every sound and footfall
till the morning dawned; and then Miss
Boscawen insisted upon her going to rest again.
"Isabel was doing very well, considering she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
hastened every thing by eating the cream so pertinaciously,
against her own better judgment;
she never could digest cream herself at any
period of her life; how could her sister expect to
do so, when she was so near her confinement?"</p>

<p>Under many promises on Miss Boscawen's
part not to forget her in the general confusion,
Christobelle retired to her room, and slept long
and soundly; when she woke again, Isabel was
in safety, and the house of Boscawen rejoiced in
a son and heir to succeed to its honours. Miss
Boscawen brought the blessed intelligence herself,
and redeemed her promise by so doing.
Christobelle wanted to fly that instant to her
sister, but Miss Boscawen objected. "She was
too young to judge of consequences," she remarked;
"she would talk too much, or laugh too
loud for Isabel's nerves. She should visit her in
proper time, and at proper seasons; she had just
seen her father, and he had taken Master Boscawen
in his arms, and pronounced him a very
fine child. Isabel was now, she hoped, asleep."</p>

<p>Christobelle said she would rise immediately,
as she wanted very much to see her father; she
was surprised to learn he had quitted Brierly
soon after his interview with Isabel. He would
not allow Christobelle to be called, because her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
rest had been broken; he left his affectionate
love, and his wishes that his child would write
often, and attend to Miss Boscawen's directions
in her conduct. He had returned to Wetheral
rather earlier than he intended, but business of
importance called him away. This was Christobelle's
first separation from her father. She
learned afterwards Mr. Boscawen's perfect approbation
of his scheme to spend some months
in Scotland; and by so doing, putting it out of
Clara's power to renew her engagement with Sir
Foster, induced Sir John to hurry away to its
fulfilment. It was his intention to leave Wetheral
in the course of a fortnight with the whole
establishment, and pass the summer at Fairlee.
Christobelle was to be Mr. Boscawen's care till
her father recalled her.</p>

<p>Isabel was delighted with that part of the
plan which decided her sister a guest at Brierly
for an indefinite period. The satisfaction of her
mind gave her strength and spirits to delight in
her little one, and to bear with unparalleled sweetness
of temper the tiresome attentions and fears
of Miss Boscawen. Nothing was quite right
with the old lady which did not emanate from
herself. The child was too upright, or it was
too long in a horizontal posture. Its food was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
acid, or too sweet; it was too tight in its clothes,
or the poor little thing was hardly kept together
in its covering. Isabel tied and untied, as the
complaint dictated; but some new fault was
ever arising to rouse the alarms of Miss Boscawen.
One morning, Isabel amused herself by
dressing her babe with her own hands, a pleasure
she had not enjoyed since its birth. The nurse
sat by her mistress's bed-side, watching and directing
the operation, while Christobelle gazed
delightedly at the little thing as it crowed and
stretched its limbs. The sisters were most pleasingly
occupied when Miss Boscawen entered.
Her alarms were roused immediately.</p>

<p>"Oh! sister, how can you sit up there, dressing
the child? Nurse, take away the infant,
your mistress will be so fatigued! you must lie
down again, sister."</p>

<p>"Sister," however, was for once resolved to
persist; she could not relinquish the delightful
amusement.</p>

<p>"Tabitha, I have not washed my child; I am
only putting on his dear little clothes."</p>

<p>"Oh! sister, you are very wrong; you suffered
by that cream which I begged you not to
touch, and now I must insist upon your lying
down; what will my brother say?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Boscawen will not object to seeing me
dress my little boy," replied Isabel.</p>

<p>"Oh! sister, he will indeed. My brother is
not aware how you fatigue yourself. Nurse,
pray take the infant from your mistress."</p>

<p>Isabel became nervous, and the baby began to
cry with all its might. Miss Boscawen was
certain he was nearly strangled by tight strings.</p>

<p>"There, sister, you have hurt him; the tapes
are tied too tightly, I dare say. How can you
dress a babe, sister, when you never had one
before? Nurse, take the poor infant."</p>

<p>A passion of tears weakened Isabel beyond all
that the mere dressing of her babe could produce.
Miss Boscawen became alarmed, and she ceased
all further expostulation. Mr. Boscawen, who
never remained long absent from his wife and
child, at this moment entered the room. Isabel
sobbed out:</p>

<p>"Mr. Boscawen!"</p>

<p>"Here I am, my love. What has discomposed
you? I am afraid you are feverish." Mr. Boscawen
seated himself in the nurse's chair, and
felt Isabel's pulse; he looked very grave. "My
dear Isabel, this pulse won't do. Nurse, what
has caused this fever?"</p>

<p>"Tabitha won't let me dress my child, Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Boscawen," sobbed Isabel, clasping her hands,
and looking heart-broken.</p>

<p>"Give your mistress her child, nurse. My
dear Isabel, you shall dress it whenever you
please. Dress it now, my love, and let me see
how maternally you can handle your infant."
Mr. Boscawen took his boy from the nurse, and
placed it in Isabel's arms. Delighted with the
action, and feeling the kindness of her husband's
manner, Isabel almost involuntarily kissed Mr.
Boscawen's hand.</p>

<p>"Oh! brother, you are very wrong," exclaimed
Miss Boscawen, looking anxiously at
Isabel, whose delight was unbounded.</p>

<p>"A mother is performing a laudable and
pleasing duty, Tabitha, when she nurses and
fondles her child."</p>

<p>"Ah! but, brother, you are very wrong.
Sister will be quite low and ill this evening. I
foretold that cream business, brother."</p>

<p>What could Miss Boscawen do? Isabel continued
to play with her child, and her brother
authorised the deed; nay, he was watching his
wife's movements with earnest and pleased attention.
Her authority was of no avail, since
her brother sanctioned such very improper exertions;
she could only sigh, and resign herself to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
her own duties&mdash;the worsted frame, and ordering dinner.</p>

<p>Miss Boscawen had a kind heart; her own
dictations were prompted by good-will to others,
and a desire to give pleasure, but then those
pleasures must proceed from herself. She loved
Isabel, and watched carefully over her health;
but Isabel must not think for herself; every
idea must originate from Miss Boscawen, otherwise
it could not be wisely carried into effect;
it could not even be wisely planned, if Miss Boscawen
had not been a party in its formation.
This was irritating and vexatious. Christobelle
was under many obligations to Miss Boscawen,
and loved her, when circumstances did not bring
her into contact with Isabel. She very patiently
undertook to teach her all kinds and varieties of
work. She learned all the worsted stitches, and
could assist her in sorting colours very ably.
Miss Boscawen protested always against idleness
in young people, and loved to see Christobelle
employed in reading, or, practising under her
tuition, the tasteful arts of tatting, embroidery,
and fancy-work. Miss Boscawen and Christobelle
were very good friends; and she often
drew her attention from Isabel, and prevented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sundry visits to her sister's room, which would
have terminated in mutual annoyance.</p>

<p>Christobelle had been a fortnight at Brierly,
when a letter from Lady Wetheral threw her
into consternation. It was a great honour to be
noticed by her mother, but its contents were astounding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 2em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Bell,<br />
</p>

<p>"You must make up your mind to return
home, and be useful in spite of your stupidity,
for I can't be left without a companion. Your
father alarms me to death with his violence;
and as to Clara, she has every excuse for the
step she has taken. You know poor Clara and
Sir Foster were very much attached, and it was
tyranny to separate them. Nothing would serve
your father but breaking off their engagement,
so Clara ran away with Kerrison the day you
quitted Wetheral. I declare I knew nothing
about Clara's intention, for your sister always
did as she pleased, without consulting me. However,
she is Lady Kerrison now, and mistress of
Ripley, which I always particularly wished might
be her destiny.</p>

<p>"Your father has been ill, and confined some
days to his room; but, I confess, <i>I</i> never was
better, or more satisfied with the contemplation</p></blockquote>

<p>of my daughters' excellent establishments. Of
course, Clara has no settlement; but Kerrison
is a poor, half-witted creature, and it will be
her fault if she does not do as she pleases with
him. The first Lady Kerrison gave way too
much. The Kerrisons arrived at Ripley two
days ago, and your father will not allow me to
call upon them. I cannot think it right to bear
malice; it would have been another thing if
Clara had married a curate, or Lesley's son. I
tell Sir John we ought to forgive as we hope to
be forgiven ourselves; but he shakes his head
like Lord Burleigh, and waves me away. Altogether,
his temper is become extremely violent,
and I must have you at home, for Thompson is
going to marry the Hatton butler, and set up a
public-house. I have no patience with servants
marrying.</p>

her figure. Whereabouts is the nursery? I
hope <i>miles</i> from her room. Tell her about the
baize door; and as boys have loud voices, give
the child lettuce lozenges, and make it sleep
day and night. I hope Boscawen won't let her
nurse it. When you return, perhaps you will
persuade your father to forgive the Kerrisons,

<p>Christobelle wept over Clara's flight; she
wept over her dear father's illness, but still more
over the summons to return and become her
mother's companion. She gave her letter to
Miss Boscawen in distress, for she could not
trust her voice. Christobelle was too young
then to understand her error in so doing. She
was not aware the letter laid bare to Miss Boscawen's
notice all her mother's private thoughts
and intentions, and that its perusal must consign
her to contempt and ridicule, in the opinion of
brother and sister. She considered only her
wretched fate in returning to Wetheral, as the
avowed companion of a person who had never
loved her, and who felt compelled to bear with
"stupidity," because Thompson was on the eve
of matrimony.</p>

<p>Miss Boscawen returned the letter without
any comment: she advised Christobelle to conceal
its intelligence from Isabel, and try to appear
gay, lest the idea of losing her sister should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
affect her spirits. It might be, Lady Wetheral's
mind would change, or some event occur to
postpone her return. She would inform her
brother of the intimation from Wetheral; but in
the mean time Christobelle was to drive all
thoughts from her mind of leaving Brierly for
some time to come.</p>

<p>With these consolations before her mental
view, combined with the hopes and sprightliness
of extreme youth, Christobelle soon forgot
her sorrow, and enjoyed, in happy forgetfulness,
the calm pleasures of Brierly. Thompson did
not make her appearance, and the Boscawens
never alluded to the transactions which had
taken place at Wetheral. In a few days, therefore,
all fears were hushed, and she resumed her
usual occupations and amusements. Isabel
made her appearance in the sitting-room in due
time, to her sister's great satisfaction; but their
mutual comfort was disturbed daily and hourly
by the watchful affection of Miss Boscawen,
who objected and demurred to every project
and action on their parts, on the score of health.
By this vexatious exaction of power on the
sister's side, one material change was effected,
which progressively gave happiness to Isabel,
and gilded the gloominess of Brierly to her eye
and heart. It drew her thoughts and affection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
towards her husband, who so often shielded her
from Miss Boscawen's anxieties, particularly in
her treatment of her son.</p>

<p>June opened so brightly in sunbeams and
flowers, that Isabel and her sister loved to sit
with the babe under the shade of a large
mulberry-tree which stood upon the lawn. The
air benefitted Isabel, and the soft rustling of
the mulberry leaves lulled the infant into sound
sleep. This pleasure was not suffered to pass
without its alloy. Miss Boscawen was not the
inventor of the agreeable <i>al fresco</i>, therefore it
was wrong.</p>

<p>"Oh, sister, don't sit there! Miss Wetheral,
my dear, come in. The flies will kill that poor
child; nurse, bring it in. Sister, your complexion!"</p>

<p>"I don't mind my complexion, Tabitha, at
all; and my child is very sleepy; it is just
closing its eyes."</p>

<p>Miss Boscawen stood at the drawing-room
window, with a parasol in her hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, but, sister, that is wrong: the child
will be bitten all over with flies. Miss Wetheral,
my dear, bring your sister in."</p>

<p>"Tabitha, here are no flies, I assure you.
Don't insist upon my leaving this shady place!"
exclaimed Isabel, beseechingly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, sister, the heat! What will my brother
say? Oh, brother, I am glad you are come, for
sister is doing very foolishly."</p>

<p>"What is Isabel doing?" asked Mr. Boscawen,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Sister is quite in a draught, brother; and the
poor child must be all over insects and flies!"</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen joined his lady. He stood for
some moments contemplating Isabel, who sat in
a low rustic chair, gently rocking the sleeping
babe on her lap. She smiled as she met his eye.</p>

<p>"Mr. Boscawen, I know you are come to
take my part. You won't insist upon my leaving
this shady seat, will you?"</p>

<p>"No, my love, I am going to enjoy it with
you." Mr. Boscawen seated himself on the
turf, at Isabel's feet. Christobelle could not
help thinking of the fairy tale which described
Beauty and the Beast. It was exemplified in
the forms before her. Isabel, so young and
delicate, sat like a fairy, graceful in every movement,
bending over her child, smiling, and delighting
to be free from her sister-in-law's
power. Boscawen, gaunt, tall, and unlovely,
lay extended near her, smiling grimly. Miss
Boscawen saw her alarms were unheeded.</p>

<p>"Oh, brother, you are wrong. Sister will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
very poorly, and you are on the damp grass
yourself&mdash;oh, brother!"</p>

<p>It was a useless lamentation: the little party
remained long and happily seated under the
mulberry-tree; and Isabel, grateful for her
husband's sanction, became less reserved in his
presence. In time, she even sought his society,
and the infant was ever a bond of union and
affection between them. Christobelle did not
think the gay, thoughtless Isabel would have
become such a fond, anxious mother, so devoted
to her child, so active as a nurse. And yet,
why was she surprised? Had not Isabel warm
affections, and was she not the favourite at Wetheral;
always kind and conciliating, always
gentle and beloved? Mr. Boscawen's age and
manners chilled Isabel's heart by his anxiety
to bestow attainments upon a mind which disliked
application; but her child was sure to call
forth every particle of her affectionate heart;
its daily wants, its helplessness, made her useful
in the way she best loved.</p>

<p>There was no more dull schooling for Isabel
to pine over&mdash;no more lectures from Mr. Boscawen
to urge her forward against her inclination,
and perhaps against her capacity. Another
object had entered upon the scene, to engross
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and charm each parent. Isabel never wearied
in watching her babe; her dislike to work chair-covers
and footstools, under Miss Boscawen's
surveillance, was now succeeded by a taste for
baby-clothes; and the quickness with which she
acquired from the nurse the mystery of cutting
out, and shaping materials, proved that an
object alone was needed to call forth her
energies.</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen was content to see his lady
so employed; the schoolmaster gave way to the
parent; and he was no longer distressed by his
young wife's thoughtless speeches. How could
Isabel talk unadvisedly, when her only subject
embraced the nursery department? How could
she alarm her husband's nice perceptions in conversation,
when all her thoughts rested in one
absorbing interest&mdash;on one dear and mutual
object of earthly pleasure?</p>

<p>Christobelle was happiest of the happy at
Brierly. Mr. Boscawen had always something
pointed in his remarks which attracted her admiration;
and if Isabel could not withdraw her
attention from her new and delightful occupation,
Christobelle was ready to profit by her
husband's extensive reading; to listen with
eagerness to his details; and enjoy his animating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
comments upon men and books. Miss Boscawen
was aware that her brother's attention
was given exclusively now to his wife and child,
to the utter exclusion of her complaints and
alarms; but her anxieties abated not. She still
objected to every arrangement, and cavilled at
all pleasures which her own brain had not devised;
she could not even participate in them.</p>

<p>Isabel had long wished to spend a day in
Bridgnorth. She knew no one in that part of
the country; she could scarcely give a reason
for wishing to visit that quiet rural spot; but
she had been struck by its beautiful scenery, as
she passed and repassed from Wetheral. She
liked its situation, its river, its luxuriant banks;
altogether, she had an extraordinary desire to
spend a day at Bridgnorth, and take her child.
It was a little change, it would be a pleasant
long drive, and she was sure every body would
like the little trip. Isabel mechanically watched
her husband as she uttered her wish. He smiled.
Isabel found a willing auditor, and her desire
waxed stronger in word and deed.</p>

<p>"Well, now, dear Mr. Boscawen, you will take
us; won't you? Chrystal and the child will
have so many things to see. To be sure, the
dear babe can't understand what he sees, but I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
shall so like to carry him about the town, and
hear people admiring his little beautiful face!"</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen was overcome. This was the
first time Isabel had ever addressed him as
"dear Mr. Boscawen," and she was tossing her
child at the moment with such grace, with such
beaming affection! He threw his long arms
round his wife and child, most ungracefully, but
most fondly.&mdash;</p>

<p>"We will do as you wish, my love; we will
go to Bridgnorth for a day&mdash;for a week, if you
prefer it."</p>

<p>Isabel smiled in her husband's embrace, and
looked truly happy. At that moment, perhaps,
a change passed over the mind of each. Mr.
Boscawen lost his alarmed and disgusted pupil
in the matronly woman and companion, at least
in <i>one</i> engrossing care. Isabel might feel that
the task-master was exchanged for a kind
and indulgent protector. Her child might engross
her heart, but she would honour its father,
and rejoice under his mild administration.
Isabel's nature was grateful: she must love those
who kindly sought her happiness; and Mr. Boscawen's
attention to her wishes would surely
secure her content of heart. Miss Boscawen
appeared the only thorn in her path likely to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
affect her peace; but the release from books
and study was to Isabel's mind emancipation
from all evils. The minor vexations of life were
hardly felt by her yielding and gentle temper.</p>

<p>The Bridgnorth excursion was at once negatived
by Miss Boscawen.</p>

<p>"Oh, sister, going to Bridgnorth! Mercy!
who do we know in Bridgnorth, brother?"</p>

<p>"My wife wishes it, Tabitha."</p>

<p>"Oh mercy, brother, what a foolish wish!
Eleven miles' drive, and a day spent in Bridgnorth!&mdash;what
for, sister?"</p>

<p>"I always admired Bridgnorth, Tabitha, and
I want to show my babe. I have set my heart
upon displaying my babe."</p>

<p>"Oh, sister, mercy! I can't think a drive to
Bridgnorth can do you any good. No, stay at
home, sister."</p>

<p>"Mr. Boscawen has no objection, Tabitha.
Have you, dear Mr. Boscawen?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but, brother, what nonsense! the child
will be sick, and sister will be so tired! Don't
go to Bridgnorth, sister: let us spend a day at
Hawkstone next week."</p>

<p>"I have set my heart upon Bridgnorth," said
Isabel, throwing an appealing glance to her
husband.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen was resolved to please his wife.
There was a link between them now, which
nothing human could dissolve. Perhaps Mr.
Boscawen silently felt pride in the idea of displaying
his "beautiful babe," as Isabel termed
it. At Brierly, beyond the establishment, there
were none to gaze and admire. An elderly
gentleman is generally proud of his first-born;
the less he says, the more apparent it becomes
in action. Mr. Boscawen watched his infant
with unceasing interest, though he seldom made
it the subject of his discourse. He was now
going to enjoy the commendations of passing
strangers in Bridgnorth. Isabel openly confessed
her pride and expectations; they only
lurked in her husband's eyes.</p>

<p>Miss Boscawen could not hear the subject
named without expressing her dissent. She had
not proposed the drive, or even imagined such
an amusement, therefore the whole affair must
be foolish and useless. Mr. Boscawen urged his
sister to remain at Brierly&mdash;there was no occasion
for her to undertake an irksome drive, if it
was so unpalatable&mdash;she could prepare a late
tea against their return. Miss Boscawen differed
in opinion.</p>

<p>"Oh, mercy, no, brother! I must go, to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
that sister does not fatigue herself. The poor
child, you know&mdash;yes, sister, I will go with you,
but, indeed, I think it a very foolish business&mdash;what
with the heat, and the poor child, I am sure
we shall all be very tired."</p>

<p>In spite of Miss Boscawen's murmurs and
prognostics, Isabel looked forward with pleasure
to the Bridgnorth visit, which was to take place
in two days from the date of its first proposition.
Isabel gloried in the idea of walking with her
infant round the Castle Hill, and up all the streets;
she was sure every body would exclaim at the
size and beauty of her boy, and it would be a day
of proud exultation to her. She was also gratefully
eloquent upon her husband's kindness in
entering at once into her plan; she was sure she
must be the happiest creature in the world, if
dear Mr. Boscawen never more required her to
read, and plague herself over maps and things.
She dearly loved nursing and singing to her babe,
and dear Mr. Boscawen had told her that morning,
he did not mind the child crying half the
night; he was only happy to see what an excellent
nurse and mother he had married. Was
not that very good of dear Mr. Boscawen?</p>

<p>Christobelle also looked forward with pleasure
to the trip; she had never been allowed to accompany
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
her family to Shrewsbury, because Lady
Wetheral said, nothing was so impolitic as displaying
a lot of coming-on girls; she had never
seen a cluster of houses beyond the small village
of Wetheral, and her mind resigned itself to most
pleasing anticipations of Bridgnorth gaiety. She
could conceive nothing more charming than roaming
with Isabel up and down the streets, and
examining the shop-windows&mdash;nothing more
sublime than standing upon the bridge, to watch
the coal-barges from its parapet&mdash;nothing more
exquisite than the permission to buy gingerbread-nuts
without remark and without ridicule. There
were not two happier beings than Isabel and
Christobelle, in their visions of the pleasures
which were to surround them at Bridgnorth.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p>How could any party, however pleasantly
arranged, prosper with Miss Boscawen as one of
its members? Nothing could exceed her restlessness,
and objection to every plan proposed.
They were not setting forth to Hawkstone, therefore
every thing was ill-devised&mdash;every preparation
was nonsensical. Mr. Boscawen rode forward
to order dinner, consequently Isabel must
endure her sister-in-law's complaints with patient
submission; and her comfort, during that lengthened
drive, must arise from silently contemplating
her child, and exchanging looks of vexation with
Christobelle. They had not quitted the Brierly
grounds, when Miss Boscawen commenced an
enumeration of miseries which must fall to their
lot from persisting in their excursion.</p>

<p>"Oh, sister, mercy! How you can wish to
spend a whole day in such a place as Bridgnorth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
I cannot imagine. The poor child will be so
uneasy, and you will be so heated; and Miss
Wetheral, my dear, you had better not walk
about, but sit quietly at the Crown with us all.
I have brought my knitting, and a piece of carpet-work;
and, mercy, sister!&mdash;what will you
do with the child? and how can you be comfortable
at the Crown with a baby?"</p>

<p>Christobelle ventured to think the baby would
prove their greatest amusement, and Isabel's
eyes and lips seconded the observation. Miss
Boscawen smiled good-humouredly upon Christobelle,
as upon a child whose opinions availed
nothing, though the motive was amiable which
produced them; but she addressed Mrs. Boscawen
in reply.</p>

<p>"Oh! sister, this is such a sad business&mdash;every
thing will be very uncomfortable, and that poor
little baby will be heated into a fever."</p>

<p>Isabel replied gently to all the uncomfortable
prophecies uttered by her sister-in-law; but their
constant repetition destroyed the pleasure of the
drive. It was vain to contend against Miss Boscawen's
reasoning, for the result was a quietly-expressed
pertinacity, which must end in the
discomfiture of her gentle antagonist: it was
equally impossible to resent an opposition which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
took its rise in anxiety for the object whom she
professed to love and watch over.</p>

<p>Miss Boscawen was not aware of her own failings;
she could not detect herself, how deeply
her desire to lead was interwoven with the affection
she professed, and really felt, towards Isabel.
That desire for power became the bane of
her young sister's repose: had Miss Boscawen
possessed that power, her kind heart would have
ministered in every thing to Isabel's happiness;
but, in striving for a poor and useless supremacy,
both parties became victims to the struggle.</p>

<p>It was so on this day of pleasure: when they
entered the town so long desired, so impatiently
anticipated as the scene of matronly pride, Isabel
was jaded and disquieted by the miseries of the
journey, and Miss Boscawen became doubly impressed
by her own complainings, that Bridgnorth
would prove a miserable affair. When
Mr. Boscawen came forward to assist them in
alighting, he was surprised at Isabel's languid
appearance, and alarmed at the languor of her
voice. Isabel was overcome by her husband's
anxious inquiry, his affectionate endearments,
and alarms about herself and his child: he stood
again before her as her protector from his sister's
vexatious remarks, ready to soothe her grief, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
advocate her cause: his presence was a relief&mdash;it
was a pleasure&mdash;she began to feel it was even
necessary now to her happiness.</p>

<p>Isabel took Mr. Boscawen's arm when she left
the carriage, and clung to it with an involuntary
movement of delight: her husband perceived the
expression of her eyes, as the warm pressure of
her hand turned his looks towards her, and that
expression agitated his feelings. He forgot Miss
Boscawen, his long companion and housekeeper
at Brierly&mdash;he forgot the sister who had borne
with him the dull routine of twenty years in
almost positive seclusion, to enjoy a new and
delightful emotion in the certainty of having at
last won his young wife's heart. That one absorbing
pleasure, so novel, and so delicious,
caused Mr. Boscawen to forget the existence of
Miss Boscawen and Christobelle, who stood ready
to receive his attentions upon Isabel's alighting.
He had flown with Isabel up stairs, followed by
the nurse and her young charge, and Miss Boscawen's
transit took place under the superintendence
of the waiter, but, on her part, in profound
silence. It was evident a severe blow had
been inflicted upon her heart or vanity, by this
unexpected movement.</p>

<p>When they entered the apartment destined to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
their use, Mr. Boscawen was still offering all
his cares and attentions to Isabel. She was arranged
most comfortably on the sofa with the
assiduity of a lover. It was not Mr. Boscawen
watching over the proprieties of an estranged
pupil&mdash;it was a husband attending to the comfort
of a beloved wife.</p>

<p>Christobelle rejoiced in the scene which gave
to her view Isabel happy and unreserved in the
presence of Mr. Boscawen. She rejoiced to think
her sister was loving him as <i>she</i> had always loved
him&mdash;that her studies must in future be as pleasing
to her sister, as they had ever appeared to
<i>herself</i>&mdash;that they should now enjoy the dressing-room
together, as sincerely as she had formerly
abhorred it. Christobelle's countenance betrayed
the thoughts of her heart, for Isabel gave her a
smiling glance as she gazed upon her; and the
annoyances of the journey faded away in the
contemplation of her happy, contented position,
as she still held Mr. Boscawen's hand, while the
babe lay sleeping in her lap.</p>

<p>Miss Boscawen made no remark, by word or
look, upon the past and present: her head was
thrown more back, and a look of injured innocence
pervaded her form and movements; but
not a syllable fell from her lips, as she moved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
in silent dignity to the table, and seated herself
to her employments for the day. Neither Isabel
nor Mr. Boscawen yet perceived their sister's
wounded feelings: they were both watching
their child, and enjoying their newly-awakened
interest in each other, by disjointed chat on the
part of Isabel, and in little, rather awkward,
fond civilities on that of Mr. Boscawen. Isabel,
too, had gained another step in intimacy and
unreserve: she now addressed her husband as
"dear Boscawen," which evidently gave intense
satisfaction to its object.</p>

<p>"I shall walk round the Castle Hill with my
baby when he wakes, dear Boscawen."</p>

<p>A pressure of the hand, and a look of pleased
expression, gave Isabel courage, and raised her
spirits to nearly their pristine height.</p>

<p>"I dare say you will go with us, dear Boscawen,
won't you? and Chrystal will like to
see the babe admired all over the town. You
shall have plenty of gingerbread-nuts, dear
Chrystal: the darling babe will be so admired.
I know you will come with us, Boscawen, won't
you now?"</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen gave a grim smile of acquiescence,
and accompanied the smile with a corresponding
squeeze of the hand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"I declare, Boscawen, you have hurt my poor
little fingers," exclaimed Isabel, with an affected
scream.</p>

<p>"Let me examine them," said her husband,
trying to gain possession of her hand. Isabel
withheld it playfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Boscawen, I declare I gave it you in
poor Wetheral chapel: don't you remember how
amused I was, and how I laughed when you put
on the ring?"</p>

<p>"Would you give it me again as willingly, if
we were to renew our vows, Isabel?" asked Mr.
Boscawen, with soft seriousness, as he caught
her hand, and stroked it with his long unshapely
fingers.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, indeed I should <i>now</i>, because you
are so good, and I should not know what to do
without you. You know you protect me from...."
Isabel's voice sunk into a whisper, which
reached her husband's ear alone; but her eyes
were directed towards Miss Boscawen, who appeared
intently occupied with her worsted work.
Mr. Boscawen smiled and patted her hand, as if
in correction. Isabel went laughingly on.</p>

<p>"I always like people who love me, but I
don't know how it is, some persons are not pleasant,
though they are kind. Mamma was very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
kind sometimes, but still, however, I love you,
dear Boscawen, very much. I suppose I always
liked you, but you frightened me so."</p>

<p>"Frightened you, my love!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you did very much after I was
married; you looked so proud and frowning,
and then those nasty books! I don't think I
quite loved you till you took my part about the
cream, and then I <i>did</i> begin in earnest: I
thought it so good of you; but when you allowed
me to dress my child, oh, then how could
I help loving you!" Isabel, under the influence
of her feelings, threw her arms round Mr. Boscawen's
neck, and burst into tears. The action
woke her infant. "There, now, Boscawen dear,
we have woke the little darling; how could you
let me talk in that way, and do such things! I
don't know what was the matter with me."</p>

<p>Isabel, in smiles and tears, began the preparation
for her child's comforts. The nurse was
summoned, and it was fed before her, as she
gazed delightedly at its movements: the face
and figure of Isabel received its greatest charm
from her maternal solicitude. Her enthusiastic
nature was interestingly and beautifully illustrated
in the devotion of her heart to this one
most loved object, and the <i>insouciance</i> of Isabel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Wetheral was buried in the deep love of her
offspring. Christobelle never remembered her
so captivating as she appeared at this moment,
when her attention was engrossed in watching
her child. The tears of grateful remembrance
were upon her cheek, yet smiles were chasing
every emotion from her heart, but those of tenderness
and a mother's pride. Mr. Boscawen
looked on, enchanted. Isabel, in the fullness of
her heart, turned for the first time since her arrival
to Miss Boscawen.</p>

<p>"Ah, Tabitha, I am sure you will be one of
our party round the Castle Hill, to enjoy my
babe's crowing delight. Do put away your
work, and join us."</p>

<p>Miss Boscawen did not look up from her
work, as she drily replied, "No, thank you,
sister."</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen thought a little promenade
would be very pleasant after a long drive, and
he joined in his lady's wish that she would attend
them.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, brother." Miss Boscawen
fixed her eyes pertinaciously upon her work:
she sat like a wax figure, motionless, and apparently
sightless.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are ill, Tabitha," observed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Isabel. "Do let me order you a glass of wine
and a biscuit. A glass of wine, dear Boscawen,
would not that do Tabitha good?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, sister."</p>

<p>"A biscuit, Tabitha."</p>

<p>"No, thank you, brother."</p>

<p>Miss Boscawen's answers to many affectionate
inquiries were equally laconic. Something was
wrong, but the cause was equally unintelligible
to her brother and sister. The walk, however,
was to take place, and, if Miss Boscawen would
not be prevailed upon to add to the little party,
she would, probably, be kind enough to put off
dinner another hour. This change in the dinner
arrangement was met with perfect assent by
Miss Boscawen.</p>

<p>"Certainly, brother."</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen looked earnestly at his sister;
but there was no ripple on the surface of the
water, to detect its agitation: the voice was dry
in its tones, but the eye was placid, and the
manner quiet and composed; one strong symptom
betrayed the disease within to her brother,
and upon that symptom he spoke.</p>

<p>"Tabitha, you are vexed about something&mdash;tell
me what it is."</p>

<p>"I am not vexed, brother."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen smiled. "I am sure all is not
right, Tabitha; you have made no objection to
a single plan proposed, since we entered this
room, therefore, you are not pleased with some
one of us."</p>

<p>"I am not displeased with you, brother."</p>

<p>"Then my wife has unfortunately offended
you."</p>

<p>Isabel flew to Miss Boscawen. "I have not
offended you, dear Tabitha, have I? No one is
ever offended with <i>me</i> long, for I am so sorry to
give offence. A thousand pardons, dear Tabitha,
if I have unintentionally hurt you, but what
could it be?"</p>

<p>"No, sister, you have not offended."</p>

<p>Isabel was free from offence, therefore her
thoughts could dwell upon her child; she did
not suspect or observe Miss Boscawen's manner.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, then, let us set off, for I am dying
to hear my child admired. Now, Chrystal, you
are head-nurse, so attend my babe in front, and
I will follow with dear Boscawen, to hear and see
every body's admiration. Now, Mr. Boscawen,
don't let us linger."</p>

<p>Isabel took her husband's hand, and he suffered
her to drag him in her lively playful way
to the door. Isabel was becoming the happy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Isabel of former days rapidly. Her sprightly
laugh, at that moment, sounded like the joyous
tones which had captivated her husband upon
their first acquaintance; she was aware of it
herself.</p>

<p>"I declare I am laughing as heartily as I used
to do, when we were engaged, dear Boscawen,
and you look so like yourself when I first saw
you, and when you thought all I did was right."</p>

<p>"I think so <i>now</i>, Isabel," said Mr. Boscawen,
drawing her to him, and looking tenderly in her
face.</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen's person and cast of features
could never assume a sentimental expression,
but Isabel was equally unsentimental herself. If
her husband looked kindly, and behaved indulgently,
she was happy; and, while her child
continued well, eating his meals heartily, and
stretching out his little arms at her approach,
no sorrow could reach the heart of its devoted
mother. Isabel would forget all grief at the
cradle of her darling babe, in whatever form it
might assail her.</p>

<p>They were sallying forth from the Crown,
when a post-chaise drove rapidly through the
north gate, and came with speed towards the
inn. For a moment they stood still to watch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
its progress. The horses were panting with fatigue,
but they were quickly unharnessed, as
a well-known voice called out with energy,
"Horses instantly to Brierly." It was Thompson.</p>

<p>Christobelle's fears instantly told her she was
to receive a summons from Wetheral, but she
had spent three happy months with Isabel, and
could not in justice complain of its hurried and
unexpected arrival. The last letters, however,
from Sir John, had not alluded to any such intention.
Mr. Boscawen had a powerful presentiment
that something was wrong at Wetheral,
and they hurried to the side of the chaise.
Christobelle caught Thompson's eye.</p>

<p>"Oh, for ever, and two days! Why, that's
Miss Chrystal, as I'm alive! Well, Miss Chrystal,
you must please to return with me immediately
to Wetheral."</p>

<p>Isabel looked bewildered; Mr. Boscawen inquired
after the health of Sir John with much
anxiety. He was quite well; but Lady Wetheral
was suffering, and required her daughter's
immediate presence; she was not to delay an
hour. Thompson produced a note written by
Lady Wetheral, which was to be put into Christobelle's
hand the instant Thompson arrived.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Bell,</p>

<p>"The moment you receive this set out, without
waiting to pack up your things, for I can't be
left a moment. I am very ill, and require one
person's whole attention. You have led an idle
life for twelve years, mousing in your father's
study, therefore, your time is come to be a little
active. I miss your sisters dreadfully. I am
glad Isabel is happy, and I wish I was so, too;
but your father is getting extremely methodistical,
which distracts me. Don't keep Thompson
a moment; you will be here this evening.</p>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-bottom: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">G. Wetheral.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Poor Isabel's day of happiness was changed
into mourning, as she stood reading the note
over her sister's shoulder. The hope of her
heart fell at this announcement into sorrow and
disappointment, and they returned into the sitting-room,
stunned by the unwelcome summons.
Isabel could only lament, and resolve to return
home; she threw her arms round Christobelle.</p>

<p>"My dear Chrystal, we have been so happy
together! What will my babe do without you;
and what will you do without the babe!"</p>

<p>Christobelle sat weeping, but could not reply
to Isabel's touching appeals.</p>

<p>"Ah, Chrystal, and what will you do for dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Boscawen's lectures and readings, and when
shall we be together again? how you will lament
my darling babe! but, Chrystal, don't cry.
I know it must be a dreadful blow to leave that
darling boy, but I will have his picture taken
every month, and send you the old one regularly.
I know Boscawen will let me have its picture
fresh every month, for he will wish it himself,
and you will be so delighted to see its innocent
face every month, too. Tell papa I <i>must</i> have
you every year, and tell Clara that she will be
very happy with Sir Foster, when a child is
born. Perhaps she won't like being at her
studies, any more than I did, but Sir Foster
won't plague her after her child is born; be sure
and tell her <i>that</i>, Chrystal."</p>

<p>Miss Boscawen forgot her injuries for the moment,
to comfort Christobelle, when the cause
of their grief was explained. Her soothings
were more useful and bracing to the spirit. She
told her that duties were imperious at home; and
she assured her that conscience through life would
be tranquil under all trials, by the knowledge
that we had been obedient and pleasing to our
parents, and, by so doing, acceptable before our
Maker, whose commandment it was to "honour
thy father and thy mother."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Tabitha," cried Isabel, earnestly;
"Chrystal does not mean to sorrow for being
recalled on that account. She feels the loss of
the dear child, and I can understand the agony
of parting with such a treasure." Isabel took
her boy from the nurse's arms, and pressed it to
her bosom. "I can tell what <i>you</i> feel, Chrystal,
for, if any one took my child from me, I should
die on the spot." The very idea of a separation
caused Isabel's cheeks to turn deadly pale.</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen appeared, and advised Christobelle
to return with Thompson from Bridgnorth,
without giving a thought to her clothes; they
should be sent after her. He considered Lady
Wetheral's wish peremptory; and, as her anxiety
to have her daughter with her was one of
Thompson's particular remarks to him, he had
ordered horses to be brought out for the Ironbridge;
the chaise was at that moment ready,
and Thompson only waited for her young lady's
presence to return to Wetheral.</p>

<p>The adieus were short. Christobelle was
again embraced by Isabel, and received a kind
farewell from Miss Boscawen, but she was hurried
away by Boscawen, without embracing her
little nephew; he feared lest Isabel should suffer
by a prolonged view of her regrets. When deposited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in the chaise, she saw Isabel nodding and
weeping, and waving her hand from the window;
her child was placed, too, where Christobelle
could see him kicking his little feet, ignorant of
his poor aunt's sorrow. Mr. Boscawen said
many kind things, which were remembered the
following day; but Christobelle could not heed
them at the time they were uttered; her eyes
and heart were at the window with Isabel. She
thought her misery could never be exceeded by
any of those trials of after-life, which Miss Boscawen
alluded to: her heart was broken&mdash;her
happiness for ever gone. The chaise moved on,
and Thompson <i>tête-à-têted</i> with her to Wetheral.</p>

<p>The silence was unbroken till the woods of
Wetheral roused them into conversation. Thompson
would not interfere with her young lady's
grief, but allowed her to exhaust its violence in
the natural way. Christobelle cried without intermission,
till they arrived within a few miles
of the castle; and Thompson, probably, was content
to remain silent, in pleasing contemplations
of her own approaching matrimony. At last
she spoke.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear Miss Chrystal, cheer up, and
think of all you will have to do. Your mamma
will not like a sorrowful face, and she is become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
very capricious and rough, since Miss Clara
married."</p>

<p>"Is mamma angry with Clara?" Christobelle
asked, mournfully.</p>

<p>"Oh! for ever, and two days!&mdash;angry? not
she indeed! but my mistress wants to visit at
Ripley&mdash;and my master, he won't allow it. She
pines very much about it, and gets melancholy;
so, as I am engaged to Mr. Daniel, at Hatton,
you are to take my place&mdash;and a terrible place
it will be; for my lady has never spoken to me
kindly since I engaged myself to Mr. Daniel,
Miss Chrystal."</p>

<p>Christobelle's tears increased at this melancholy
picture of her future destiny. Poor
Thompson, who always loved her, strove to impart
comfort.</p>

<p>"Pray, don't cry so terribly, dear Miss Chrystal,
for your papa is always kind and pleasant, and
you are such a favourite, you know. My lady,
she does give way to whims, as I can testify;
but my master, he never was any thing but polite
and proper. Mr. Daniel tells me that whims
run always in the female line; but he only says
that, Miss Chrystal, to plague me."</p>

<p>Christobelle inquired if her father had heard
from Anna Maria, or if her sister Julia was still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
at Bedinfield. Thompson put her finger to her
lip with a mysterious air.</p>

<p>"Miss Chrystal, there is something going on
there which I can't make out, neither can Mr.
Daniel. My lady, she wrote to invite herself to
Bedinfield for change of air, after Miss Clara's
marriage, and a letter came in reply from the
dowager, which I never made out clearly; for
my master, he had a long interview with my
lady, and nothing was said about it. My lady
wept a good deal, but she never spoke to me
upon the subject, which I do not take kindly,
for I have always been consulted upon family
matters; and Heaven knows, Miss Chrystal,
how I held forth upon poor Miss Clara's sweet
temper, when you know her best mood would
turn milk into vinegar!"</p>

<p>"And Anna Maria?"</p>

<p>"Oh! for ever, Miss Chrystal, what a place
that Paris is! Mrs. Pynsent, our young lady
that was, writes word they are coming home,
for they have not eaten an intelligible thing since
they quitted Wetheral. Poor young Mr. Pynsent
declares a vixen fox roasted and well peppered,
would be far better than the ragouts and
frogs he has been obliged to eat since he left
old England. Mr. Daniel says, the Hatton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
people have sent them an invitation to return
there for a time. Mrs. Pynsent, the old lady,
has been very low and poorly since her son married,
and she spends almost every other day with
Mrs. Hancock."</p>

<p>They turned, at this moment, from the high-road
into the Wetheral grounds, and Christobelle
was obliged to compose her features and heart
into something like external tranquillity. She
made fearful efforts to banish Isabel and Brierly
from her thoughts; she could not think upon
the child whom she loved so dearly. She tried
to remember alone her father's precepts, and act
upon his often repeated cautions, to begin early
in life the important task of sacrificing pleasure
to duty, and to pray for strength to act uprightly
and obediently to his laws. She did pray at
this moment; and her earnest repetition of the
prayer which he taught her to offer up daily to
her parent in heaven, caused some words to escape
which reached Thompson's ear. She turned
towards her with quickness.</p>

<p>"Well, for ever and two days, Miss Chrystal,
if you are not saying your prayers! Don't let
my lady hear you going on so, or she will be
angry; she called me a methodist the other day
with her own lips, because I said just a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
words about Mr. Daniel being a church-going
man: and so he is, Miss Chrystal, I assure you."</p>

<p>Christobelle's heart leaped when she saw her
father standing upon the lawn, as they drove up
the avenue. The happy hours, the quiet delights
of his study, his affection for her, his long, solitary
readings, while she was absent&mdash;all and
each pressed upon her mind, and absorbed all
thoughts of Brierly. There he stood watching
their approach, and smiling upon his child the
same benignant smile which ever welcomed her
presence into his study: she held out her arms,
though she could not reach him; but the chaise
stopped, and she was soon in the parental embrace.
How was she caressed and welcomed
after an absence of three months!</p>

<p>Christobelle thought there was a change in
her father; but she was too young to discover
or dwell upon the cause. She fancied his manner
more grave, and his voice was melancholy;
but her attention was attracted to a thousand
trifles, and she forgot to gaze upon him. She
was listening to all that had occurred in her absence.
Christobelle took tea with her father
alone, and to him she detailed the happiness she
had enjoyed at Brierly; the odd ways of Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Boscawen, the perfect bliss of Isabel: a smile
lighted up his countenance.</p>

<p>"I married Isabel to a good man, and she
was certain of happiness: her child is a delightful
gift, but her content proceeds from her husband's
temper and principles. Isabel is a warm-hearted
girl; she must be happy with Boscawen."
Christobelle assured him her thoughts
were wrapped up in her babe, much more than
in Boscawen. Isabel only lived for her child.</p>

<p>"She may think so," replied Sir John, "and
you may judge it is so; but when you have
lived a little longer, you will both perceive a
woman's happiness to depend upon her husband's
principles. If he is worthless, she must be
miserable; and children increase the misery, if
she loves them. Boscawen is a good man, and
Isabel is happy. Be careful in <i>your</i> choice,
Chrystal."</p>

<p>"Oh! papa, you shall choose for me."</p>

<p>"Very well, my love; if I live, I will be your
counsellor; but if your father is taken from you,
beware of marrying for any motive of worldly
considerations. Marry with esteem; and, if
you believe a man to be religious, performing
his duties as a son and brother with kindliness
and affection, then love him, for he will deserve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
your affection. Beware of marrying for affluence
alone; your fate will be then as Julia's or
Clara's fate."</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral's voice sunk into low, pathetic
tones as he concluded, and Christobelle
was silent from an awful feeling which stole over
her frame, and forbade remark. A tap at the
door roused them from the silence of many
minutes; it was Thompson with a message from
Lady Wetheral, requesting her daughter's presence.
Christobelle looked at her father with
alarm; her hour was arrived, when the things
of this world must no longer appear like a
vision of beauty; her life, in future, would be a
lengthened chain of annoyances, and she must
bend to the destiny which awaited her. She
followed Thompson to her mother's apartments,
where she had secluded herself since Lady Kerrison's
marriage, in terror; but Sir John had
smiled upon the movement, and Christobelle
could not escape her lot. She was certain of an
unpleasant reception, but restrained her tears
from flowing. Lady Wetheral was seated near
her work-table, upon which six wax-lights stood
burning. She looked up.</p>

<p>"Oh! you are come, Bell: there, sit down,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
for I can't bear any one to come near me, heating
the atmosphere. I think you are grown tall
and gawky with your visit; it's very odd you
should be so much plainer than your sisters. I
suppose Isabel is very busy with her boy, poor
thing! I hope all her children will be boys;
girls are great plagues. Your father will not
allow me to see poor dear Clara, and there is no
settlement made upon her, which worries me to
death. Suppose Sir Foster dies, and Clara should
become a widow without any provision; I can't
be troubled with any of you again. I can't be
annoyed with daughters returning upon me,
when I have taken such pains to establish them.
I am extremely worried about Clara, and my
spirits are sinking fast; not a soul to take care
of me. Thompson on the eve of marrying!&mdash;nonsensical
stuff! Servants, of all people,
marrying! Daniel can't settle fifty pounds upon
Thompson, and so I tell her, simpleton!"</p>

<p>Christobelle had nothing to offer in the way of
consolation; she was always under a spell before
her mother. Her tone of voice, too, was irritable,
and the fear of offending closed her daughter's
lips from answering. Lady Wetheral proceeded.</p>

<p>"You are awkward and dumb as ever, Bell:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
don't wriggle in your chair, and look so intolerably
stupid. I thought Boscawen would have
talked or read you into something like ease of
manner. I shall be tired to death with your
abrupt motions revolving round me. I must
make you useful in your influence over your
father, Bell; and you must contrive to gain his
consent to our visiting at Ripley. Your poor
father is become very selfish in many things. I
meant to pay a visit of a few weeks to Bedinfield,
but the dowager has sent me a letter I can't understand.
Your father says the purport of it is
to decline my company, but I could see no purport
at all. The Pynsents are in France, and I
never liked Boscawen; therefore I ought not to
be refused my poor Clara's society. This is
dreadful seclusion, and I have this little illumination
to drive away blue devils. I never
see Sir John now; my influence is quite gone."</p>

<p>It was necessary Christobelle should now endeavour
to enter into conversation, and assist,
as far as lay in her power, to console and amuse
the disquietudes of her mother's mind. She,
therefore, inquired if it was a true report concerning
Anna Maria's return to England.</p>

<p>"Yes, Anna Maria is on the point of returning
from Paris, very much against my wishes; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
will be only a secondary person at Hatton, and
their complaints are very foolish about that fine
city. I think every thing has gone wrong since
my daughters married; I have not been well or
happy since Clara left me, and never shall be
again."</p>

<p>"I hope you will, mamma; I will do all I can
to please you."</p>

<p>"What can you do?" replied her mother,
quickly, and with considerable irritation in her
tone; "you are too young to establish, or to think
about it these three years; how can <i>you</i> please
me? I am declined at Bedinfield by the dowager,
who, I am sure, manages her son and his wife,
for neither of them added a line to regret my
postponement, if it <i>was</i> one; but I could not understand
it. My daughter Pynsent cannot ask
me to Hatton when she returns; she will be a
guest herself. I must not see Clara; and if I
did, she has no settlement. What pleasure has
accrued to me from their splendid matches?"</p>

<p>None, certainly, as far as Christobelle could
judge from her mother's complaints, but surely
Brierly was a home of happiness; she told her so.</p>

<p>"Brierly may suit <i>you</i>, Bell, but what amusement
would it be to me? Isabel spoiling her
figure and disordering her dress, by carrying a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
heavy child about all day; Miss Boscawen sitting
upright like all the generation of old maids; and
Boscawen keeping only a pair of horses, and
never entertaining the neighbourhood! I should
be shocked and distressed all day."</p>

<p>"They were so happy, mamma!"</p>

<p>"I dare say, Bell: so are the pigs when they
have clean straw and plenty to eat. I can't
fancy any thing but merely animal enjoyments
at Brierly."</p>

<p>Who could reply to such determined obliquity
of reasoning? Christobelle perceived, indeed,
that four splendid matches had failed to produce
pleasure to her mother's mind. Each establishment
appeared clogged with an evil, which overbalanced
their boasted worth and magnificence.
Deeply as she coveted, and had laboured for her
daughters' wealthy suitors, the affluence of their
position could now give no satisfaction. The
excitement was over, the objects were attained;
and the disadvantages connected with each were
now as fluently expatiated upon as were once
their glory and their triumph. All this language
of complaint, this unexpected and unfounded
source of grievance, pained and dispirited Christobelle.
It was ceaseless in its flow, and hurtful
in its consequences, to herself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Wetheral's nature and temper was
changed in her daughter's eyes: that agreeable
fascination of manner, which so often softened
away an abrupt expression, was departed; the
playful tone of voice and action, which had so
long held powerful influence over her husband's
mind, was no more. Her ladyship became secluded
and irritable, pining over Clara's banishment,
regretting the absence of her settlement,
and offended at her own banishment from Bedinfield,
till it became painful to approach her;
and Christobelle's spirits sunk under the confinement
and terror of her presence. She became
ill; and her father's anxiety sought a
remedy for the evils she endured, by issuing a
pardon to the errors of Lady Kerrison, and admitting
the families to a renewal of its ancient
association. This proved the signal for domestic
peace.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral, eager to profit from the permission
so tardily bestowed, flew immediately to
Ripley: the carriage was at the door in a quarter
of an hour after peace had been declared;
and she quitted her solitary apartments, in the
highest apparent health and spirits. During her
absence, Thompson appeared before Christobelle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and begged she would apologize to her lady for
a step she felt called upon to take during her
lady's absence, for many reasons. Christobelle
inquired with surprise to what she alluded.</p>

<p>"Oh, for ever, Miss Chrystal! I think the
fashion of runaway matches is coming into vogue
at Wetheral. I have had many conversations
with my lady; but, really, they have been of so
unpleasant a nature, that I must beg to take
French leave, as Miss Clara did. Assure her
ladyship, if you please, Miss Chrystal, of my
sorrow at being obliged to part in this cursory
sort of way; but, as I am engaged to marry
Mr. Daniel to-morrow morning, it is useless to
argue the affair any longer. I hope, Miss Chrystal,
you will do me the honour to call upon me,
and take tea, some fine Sunday, with us. We
shall always be sensible of the attention."</p>

<p>Christobelle stared at Thompson's disclosure;
but she was dressed for departure, and appeared
anxious to be gone. Christobelle said her mother
would miss her services, and who was to
succeed her in performing those which Lady
Wetheral required? Thompson smiled.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Chrystal, my lady will not be
very much surprised, for I have threatened some
time to leave suddenly. I have been baited like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a bull, these two months, about Mr. Daniel; and
yet, miss, the church enjoins matrimony to servants
as well as other people. Mr. Daniel quotes
St. Paul, to prove the thing. However, I decline
any more controversy; for, my lady, she loses her
temper now: therefore, I shall be much obliged
by your informing her of this step."</p>

<p>Christobelle gave the required assurance, that
she would herself name the affair to her mother;
and Thompson, after making her adieus, and repeating
the pleasure she should feel in receiving
Miss Chrystal to tea, quitted Wetheral and its
eventful scenes, to seek a new home, and become
the property of Daniel Higgins.</p>

<p>Christobelle was reading with her father a
scene in Macbeth, when Lady Wetheral entered.
She had returned from Ripley; and the extreme
paleness of her countenance, her trembling hands,
and quivering lip, announced some fearful accident
or event. She laid her hand upon her husband's
shoulder, and looked in his face, but did
not utter a word. Sir John grasped her hands,
and bade her be composed; but his lady's distress
prevented all utterance for some moments:
at length, a deep sob relieved her, and she spoke
in hurried accents&mdash;</p>

<p>"John&mdash;the brute has beaten her!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir John feared his lady's intellects were
shaken by some horrible accident: he again
took both her hands, and seated her, beseeching
her to gain calmness, and explain the cause of
her agitation. Lady Wetheral placed her hand
upon her heart, and wept for some time in silence.
It was distressing to look upon her,
suffering, without possessing a knowledge of
its cause, or being able to soothe its violence.
A pause ensued, till the paroxysm of weeping
relieved her heart, and enabled her to account
for the extraordinary emotion. She took her
husband's hand, and spoke in broken sentences.</p>

<p>"John, I did not believe Sir Foster's temper
was so bad as people represented&mdash;I did not
think he would use Clara ill; or, indeed, John,
she should never have entered Ripley, to be
treated like his spaniel&mdash;oh, John!"</p>

<p>"Tell me, at once, Gertrude, what you mean,"
said her husband, calmly.</p>

<p>"I went to Ripley, John, to give my daughter
the delightful information of your having overlooked
her little fault; and I entered the sitting-room,
where Clara and Sir Foster were
quarrelling, oh, so dreadfully!&mdash;I was exceedingly
shocked&mdash;I did not think a daughter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
mine would ever quarrel as Clara did, with her
husband&mdash;it was so underbred&mdash;so very vulgar!
Sir Foster swore he would kick Clara, if she
persevered in her assertion&mdash;it was all about a
wretched fishmonger.&mdash;Clara persisted, and my
child was knocked down before my eyes&mdash;I saw
my beautiful Clara upon the ground; her features
swollen, and her dear face crimson. Oh,
John, I never saw such a scene!"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral again wept, and proceeded
brokenly to describe her feelings and continue
her account.</p>

<p>"I never felt so distressed and shocked in my
life! I had always inculcated the propriety of
commanding their temper into my daughters'
minds. I always laid great stress upon the bad
taste of making scenes for servants to report and
comment upon. I am sure I lectured my girls
by the hour, on the necessity of keeping up appearances,
and avoiding scenes&mdash;public scenes&mdash;which
the neighbourhood must ridicule. I cannot
bear that Clara should become an object of
ridicule. What will Mrs. Pynsent say? Nothing
can equal my shocked feelings. I told Sir Foster,
he was a brute, too disgusting and monstrous
for remark or notice from <i>me</i>; and I assured
Clara, her violence of temper had done little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
credit to my instructions, and ruined her appearance
most cruelly. My observations were
of no avail; Clara persisted in asserting the
odious fishmonger was right in his charges, as
she raised herself from the ground, and another
blow was struck. Oh, John, I left my child
bleeding on the ground&mdash;neither of them listened
to me, or replied to me. What can be done to
hush up this dreadful scene, for my cries brought
in three footmen? Oh, John, what is to be
done?"</p>

<p>Her ladyship's tears again flowed copiously.</p>

<p>"I will go, instantly, to Ripley," said Sir John,
seriously, but calmly. "Chrystal, my love, be
ready to accompany me in ten minutes."</p>

<p>"I shall want Bell to talk to, my love&mdash;don't
take that great girl with you, every where."</p>

<p>"I particularly wish to point out to my daughter's
notice the misery and crime of connecting
herself with a man whose only virtue is the possession
of riches, Gertrude. Make haste, Chrystal;
the carriage will be round in ten minutes."</p>

<p>Christobelle flew to her room, and prepared to
accompany her father. When she returned to
the study, it was empty. Lady Wetheral had
returned to her apartments, and Thompson was
no longer there to receive and assist her. Christobelle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
was on the point of ascending the stairs,
to make known her flight, but the carriage was
already at the door, and her father called for
her. She entered the carriage as her mother's
bell rang furiously, but time was too precious
for delay; the order was given, and they proceeded
towards Ripley with rapidity.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p>Sir John Wetheral spoke very seriously to his
daughter during their rapid transit: he pointed
out the crime of sacrificing principle and content
upon earth, to bow to idols which tempted the
worst passions of human nature, and gave the
soul to mammon. He laid before her notice the
fate of those who forgot their Maker's injunction,
to care for their soul, and not for the body; and
who strove for earthly things, without considering
they could not carry them to that place,
where the innocent and upright spirit alone could
be triumphant.</p>

<p>Christobelle listened to her father's mild admonitions
in silent, pleased attention, and her
heart drank in the holiness of the subject, and
the justice of his remarks; but when he changed
his tone and subject, to charge himself with negligence,
in allowing his lady's influence to prevail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
over his better reason&mdash;when he took blame to
himself for allowing the marriage of Julia, so
contrary to his own wishes, to a man so little
calculated to make her happy, and prophecied,
in melancholy accents, that his grey hair would
be brought in sorrow to the grave, by his own
unpardonable indolence, and blind affection&mdash;<i>then</i>
she wept to hear him, and pressed his hands
to her heart.</p>

<p>"Do not say so, papa&mdash;do not die, or what
will become of me?"</p>

<p>He smiled at her energy.</p>

<p>"I am not going before my appointed time,"
he said, putting one arm round her waist. "I
shall not leave <i>you</i>, Chrystal, unprotected, whenever
that time may arrive, for your mind is stored
with those precepts which can mitigate the evils
of this world. You have a parent, my child, who
is not a fallible father, such as I am, and to Him
I commit you, and did commit you from your
birth. You were given up exclusively to me, with
your poor mother's consent&mdash;indeed, by her expressed
wish&mdash;and I have endeavoured to lead
your mind to those truths which must advance
your happiness. I have led you, Chrystal, to
the fountain of living waters, and from that fountain
you will drink the cup of tribulation, but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
will be sweetened by the knowledge that it came
from His hands&mdash;that all trials are sent to the
good, to see if their faith is sincere, and their
patience an abiding trust in Him who gives and
takes away. If, Chrystal, your earthly father is
taken away, and your home broken up, remember
that Father above, and remember that house
made without hands, promised to all who walk
steadily and faithfully to the end."</p>

<p>Christobelle's heart was wrung with the seriousness
of her father's words, and the peculiar
tone in which they were uttered: it seemed that
he was preparing to leave for ever the home, and
the study, which had sheltered her youth from
every storm, and had been the scene of their
daily and long communion together. If her
father was no more, who besides Isabel would
cherish his companion, and love her as he had
done? Who would save her from her mother's
irony, and soothe her increasing irritability towards
her? Christobelle became wild with the
idea of his early death, and, clasping her hands,
cried, "Oh! dearest papa, don't talk so&mdash;don't
frighten me, and promise not to leave me."</p>

<p>"Nay, Chrystal," he replied, soothingly, "do
not alarm yourself; I am here in present health;
and I trust, for some years to come, to be allowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to watch over you. I <i>speak</i> seriously, because
my words will be remembered by you hereafter,
when I may not be near to give counsel; and I
<i>think</i> seriously, because Clara's unhappy marriage
may affect her conduct and character: she is too
young to escape the contamination of passing
her life with Sir Foster Kerrison."</p>

<p>Sir John became agitated as they turned into
Ripley Park, and drew near the house which
held his unfortunate daughter: he wished to gain
firmness with gentleness for the approaching interview,
and he muttered several times, quickly,
"I hope I shall not forget myself!&mdash;God help me,
I hope I shall not forget myself!" He was agitated
even to nervousness, when they drove past
the conservatory, and the bells pealed their arrival;
but Christobelle was then too young and
inexperienced to be useful, or even to understand
the depth of a parent's agony. She followed
him in silence to the hall and into the sitting-room,
where Clara lay extended upon a chaise-longue,
with a bandage round one arm, and a
severe bruise upon her eye. She rose, upon their
entrance, with self-possession, and, apparently,
with utter oblivion regarding the past, for her
eyes flashed with angry feelings, and she spoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
only of the present moment, and of her own
distress.</p>

<p>"You are come to witness a pretty scene at
Ripley, papa, and to congratulate Sir Foster, of
course, upon being the greatest brute in Shropshire.
Pray see if 'brute' is not legibly stamped
upon my arm, and written upon my left eye.
Look at this, papa."</p>

<p>Clara drew the bandage from her arm, and a
dreadful sight presented itself: her anger rose
as she gazed upon it.</p>

<p>"If my absence should give <i>one</i> qualm to that
brute, I would never see his face again; but I
will plague his heart out!"</p>

<p>Her father was greatly shocked: he was
offended and disturbed by the exhibition of
Clara's temper, but he detested the cowardly
violence of a man who could strike a helpless
wife, even through extent of provocation: his
first movement was to insist upon her return
home. "Return with me to Wetheral, Clara,
instantly; I will not see you treated like a slave,
or bear that my daughter should be struck down
like a dog, by a coward! Clara, return to your
home, and I will tell Sir Foster he shall reach
you again through my heart."</p>

<p>Clara shook her head. "Papa, I detest Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Foster; and I would willingly fly to the wilds
of America, if that distance would free me from
his brutal presence&mdash;but my mother would speak
bitterly to me. She drove me to Ripley by
everlasting persuasions, and I will not bear her
taunts at my return. My mother has done this
by her love of high establishments, and I am
married! She told me this morning, anger
ruined my appearance; but <i>she</i> has ruined my
happiness. Nevertheless, I'll plague his torpid
heart, and torment him by day and by night!
He shall feel that I can strike, too, in another
way!"</p>

<p>"Clara," cried her father, "let me not hear
such dreadful threatenings from a young woman's
lips...."</p>

<p>"I will threaten!" interrupted Lady Kerrison,
starting to her feet; "and I will do it! Am I
to be bearded on every side, without revenge?
I am passionate by nature, but I am raging with
ill-usage, and I'll torment him&mdash;yes, I will retort
upon him faithfully!"</p>

<p>Such language from a youthful and beautiful
creature seemed to stun her father; and Christobelle
stood petrified at such a display of female
intemperance. Could this be Clara, her own
sister? Was this irritable creature the sister of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Isabel, of Julia, of Anna Maria? As she stood
baring her arm, and fixing her eyes upon her
father, she looked a Pythoness unveiling future
woes and tribulations to the enemies of her
country.</p>

<p>Clara was yet standing, when Sir Foster
walked into the room, tapping his boot, and
humming his usual air: the same smile was upon
his lips, and the same vacant expression was
upon his features: he nodded familiarly to his
guests, as though their parting was but of yesterday,
and he sat down in his capacious-cushioned
arm-chair as quietly, and with the same
enjoyment, as formerly. His eye glanced at
Clara, and a chuckling sound proceeded from his
throat&mdash;the same note of internal gratification
which issued in the boudoir, when Lucy Kerrison
detailed his prowess with the fishmonger.
Clara understood its meaning, and she pointed
towards him with a bitter contempt.</p>

<p>"There he sits, smiling and curling his audacious
lip, as if he was thinking of any thing but
cowardice and cruelty! Would you imagine
that man could strike a woman to the ground,
for upholding justice and right?"</p>

<p>Sir Foster winked his eye with the rapidity
which denoted observation; his colour rose at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Clara's remark, but he did not reply. Why did
Clara persevere?</p>

<p>"Would you think <i>that</i> animal, called a man,
ever rose from his dulness to revenge himself
upon my person, for affronts he dared not revenge
upon a fishmonger?"</p>

<p>Sir Foster was roused: he approached Clara,
and held her arm. "Will you hold your tongue,
or I'll kick you to the devil!"</p>

<p>"No, I will not hold my tongue: I tell you
the man was right&mdash;right&mdash;right&mdash;he was right&mdash;if
I die saying it! Now, will you dare touch
me before my father, coward?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Clara!" Christobelle exclaimed, "do not
persist in using provoking words&mdash;oh, be like
Isabel!"</p>

<p>"I'll be Clara Wetheral," she replied, indignantly;
"I will never submit to tyranny, or
crouch to brutality. I would spurn a quarrel
about a salmon! Beat a woman about a salmon!&mdash;is
there a coward upon earth who would dare
have acted as this man has done?"</p>

<p>Sir Foster appeared irritated to the top of his
bent, and his hand was raised to strike. Sir
John Wetheral could be silent no longer; he
called to his son-in-law, in piercing tones, "Kerrison,
be a man!" Sir Foster did not touch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Clara&mdash;he turned away with a great effort, and
resumed his seat; but he closed his fist, and shook
it at his wife.</p>

<p>"If I don't wallop you some day properly!"</p>

<p>"Ay, when the fishmonger returns," answered
Clara, in taunting tones.</p>

<p>The father's distress at witnessing this scene
cannot be described. A parent may feel with
him the desolation of heart he endured, as he
listened to his daughter's unadvised and unwomanly
railing, and comprehend his deeply-pained,
disgusted feelings&mdash;but no pen can depict it.
He stood for some moments unable to master his
emotion; and, to all appearance, he was bowed
down under its influence. Christobelle was
sure the effect of this scene would have a fearful
result, and that his mind would dwell upon the
reckless conduct of Clara, and her future destiny,
till his health would suffer. When utterance
returned to his opened lips, which had essayed in
vain to move, Sir John advanced to Sir Foster,
and spoke kindly, but firmly.</p>

<p>"I have seen a dreadful quarrel between two
people, who are my near relations, and who have
been married three months: this is a sight,
Sir Foster...."</p>

<p>"Plaguy devil!" muttered Sir Foster.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have seen great provocation on Clara's
part, but I beseech you never to lay your hand
upon my daughter, as you hope to see your own
children happy in marriage."</p>

<p>"His boys are brutes already," exclaimed
Clara, haughtily.</p>

<p>"Peace, Clara," replied her father, "and hear
me, while I call upon <i>you</i>, by the affection I have
ever felt, and the kindness I have shewn, to be
gentle and obedient to your husband."</p>

<p>A laugh of contempt broke from Lady Kerrison.
"Yes, papa, obey an hyena, and be gentle
to a tyrant!"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;&mdash; me, if I stand this!" cried Sir Foster,
provoked beyond endurance, and, seizing a heavy
volume from the table, he hurled it at Clara's
head: it missed its aim, and fell at Christobelle's
feet. Clara again laughed contemptuously.
Christobelle rose in alarm, but her fears were
not for herself; she threw her arms round Sir
Foster, in terror, and implored him to overlook
her sister's conduct. She found fluency of speech,
as she besought him to bear with her temper, and
take no notice of her remarks. She implored
him to think of her dear father, and to promise
he would never strike Clara, let her conduct be
ever so provoking. "Oh, leave the room, Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Foster, when Clara becomes angry, but do not
throw such dreadful things at her!&mdash;do not commit
murder in your passion!"</p>

<p>Sir Foster winked his eye during this address,
and smiled, but Christobelle could perceive all
decorum was banished between them, for he replied
with coarseness, "I'll serve her out, if she
jaws in that style."</p>

<p>It was impossible to interfere with Sir Foster
and his lady, when each party forgot prudence
and propriety alike. It was but too evident
that Clara disdained to conciliate, and that she
rendered her husband furious by unfeminine and
violent opposition. From the coarse mind of
Sir Foster also, that mind which Sir John had
deprecated&mdash;which his lady had palliated&mdash;which
every one connected with Ripley deplored&mdash;from
such a mind, under the influence
of provocation, nothing but abusive language
could proceed, or violent conduct be elicited. It
was therefore incumbent upon Clara to obey the
wishes of a man with whom her life must pass
away in wrangling, should she oppose his measures.
But Clara had never curbed the strength
of her passions: her mother's influence had never
been exerted to reach and amend that peccant
part, and, as the wife of Sir Foster, those passions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
increased to the threatened destruction
of her happiness and respectability. It was impossible
the present state of things could exist.
Sir Foster or Clara must yield in time, and who
was to watch the conflict?</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral placed his hand upon the
bell-rope, and waved his hand to demand attention.
He besought them to heed his words, ere
he rang for the carriage to convey him from a
scene which had harrowed up his soul; this was
no time for reproach and recrimination; he
would reproach no one; he perceived both
parties were in fault, and he trusted they would
both see their mutual error. "It was grand
in a man," he said, "to overlook a wife's failings;
her helplessness, her weakness, demanded
indulgence, and a woman never looked so lovely
in the eyes of God and man, as in her performance
of the duties allotted her. He would
now depart, firmly believing he was quitting
two rational beings, responsible for their breach
of vows to a higher authority than himself. He
would hope all things; he would hope, nay, he
was certain, each party regretted the transactions
of the day, and he trusted all remembrance
of its bitterness was ended. He must now return
to Wetheral."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Foster made no reply in words: he attended
to his father-in-law's gentle admonitions,
because his usual winking motions and smile
evidenced his powers of hearing; but Clara betrayed
her withdrawn attention by the half-closed
eye and head averted. When her father
approached to take leave, she saluted him with
affection, and expressed a desire to see him often
at Ripley.</p>

<p>"Come very often, papa, pray, and see if I
am alive. Don't leave me quite in the power
of the brutes around: the five boys are enough
to kill a giantess, and the next book thrown at
my head may do mischief."</p>

<p>Oh that propensity to repeat and allude to
past disagreeables! Not a shadow of tact had
descended to Clara from her mother, to preserve
domestic peace. The reckless speech again
woke up contention; for Sir Foster advocated
his own system of education, by exclaiming,&mdash;"Hold
your tongue, will you?"</p>

<p>"I shall <i>not</i> be silent," retorted Clara:
"don't expect to make me subservient to your
vulgar prejudices, as your first wife was compelled
to be. I insist upon saying your five boys are
like your terriers in every particular."</p>

<p>The presence of her father checked the action
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
which would, under other circumstances, have
dealt heavy punishment upon the speaker. Sir
Foster ground his teeth, but the closed fist attested
his intention, and the respect which induced
the effort to curb his resentment. Clara
saw the effect of her father's presence upon his
mind, and madly took advantage of the moment
to continue her invectives.</p>

<p>"They are terriers in their features, terriers
in disposition, and terriers in their feeding."</p>

<p>Sir Foster became pale with rage: he was a
man of few words, but his wrath was terrible to
witness. He called down every imprecation
upon his lady's head, and vowed most fearfully
to "wallop her" the first convenient opportunity.
Sir John hastened Christobelle from the
contemplation of such dreadful looks, and from
the sound of such horrible words. He withdrew
with her as their voices rose high in altercation,
and left the scene of turbulence far, far
behind.</p>

<p>Christobelle had indeed seen the misery of a
match formed upon the baseless fabric of worldly
riches. She saw it was unblest and full of woe.
Their drive to Wetheral was silent and sad, for
there was that upon the father's mind which
banished repose. Clara's nature was too fearless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and too violent to render her an object of
esteem, or even to awaken compassion in her
lot. Her determined insolence, and contemptuous
bearing, towards her husband&mdash;her daring
manner, and offensive observations, were insupportable
to the eye and the ear. It was impossible
to advocate the cause of a being, however
youth might plead extenuation, who had
deliberately and clandestinely married Sir Foster
Kerrison, in defiance of her father's strongly
expressed objections, yet, in three months' matrimony,
dared to the uttermost the passions of
her chosen companion for life.</p>

<p>Much as her father sorrowed over his daughter's
destiny, he could not uphold her cause;
her passions were too powerful, too unrestrained
for his interference; he could not upbraid Sir
Foster, when he had witnessed the provocation
given by Clara, and he could not again offer his
home to a disobedient wife. Clara must henceforth
be a warning to her acquaintance, a beacon-light
to warn them from the perils she had
scorned, defied, and sunk under. But who had
guided Clara to this perilous position? who had
taught her youth to covet wealth, and stake her
happiness against title and affluence without
reflection?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, mothers! what do you gain upon this passing
scene, by bartering your children's welfare for
a tinkling sound?&mdash;what will you gain hereafter,
when the souls committed to your care on earth
are required at your hands? Is the atheist, the
gambler, the reckless, and blasphemer, to receive
them, and become responsible for their lost state
at the great account? I tell you it is not so;
you have sold their minds to mammon, and you
shall answer for that you have received, and
have not given back.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral had discovered Thompson's
flight when Sir John and Christobelle returned
to Wetheral, and her indignation was extreme.
To be left by a menial in that offensive manner
was degrading; but that Thompson should have
flown from her duties, to enter matrimony, was
disgusting. Thompson marrying! and with all
the mystery of an heiress too! It was an insult
she had not believed Thompson would have presumed
to offer; but every thing was wrong,
every thing was most wretched since her daughters
had married. What was now left to her
but poor Sir John, who was half a methodist,
and an awkward girl, who was as learned as she
was plain? It was very odd her intention to
visit Bedinfield had been frustrated. She supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
all her children intended to decline her
visits.</p>

<p>With these ideas and feelings, it was not to
be supposed Lady Wetheral could be happy;
and her disappointed mind preyed upon her
health and temper. Christobelle was the victim
of this state of things; she could never be sufficiently
attentive or sufficiently agreeable; she
was tiresome, awkward, or learned; she was to be
an old maid, a nuisance in society, an arguing, philosophical
excrescence, whom people would avoid
and detest; she had not half the sense and conversation
of poor, dear Thompson. Christobelle's
spirits fled under constant and frivolous exertion
of the power of tormenting. She was seated
in the boudoir, with Lady Wetheral, one morning
at work, not many days after the scene at Ripley;
the irritability of her temper was increased
by the recollection of former days and former
employments. She commenced her usual complaints.&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think I am worse in health and spirits
when I sit in this room; it puts me in mind of
my poor daughters, who are gone. I am now
quite deserted and forlorn; not one of them invites
me to their home!"</p>

<p>Christobelle mentioned Brierly and the affection
of its inmates.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fiddlestick, Bell! you are always quoting
Brierly! I don't like Boscawen. I have no
opinion of a man who allows his wife to be
driven by a pair of horses, when he can afford
four&mdash;I dislike avarice. And Isabel would
make me so nervous, by carrying a great heavy
baby about, and disordering her dress! I shall
never visit Brierly."</p>

<p>"The Pynsents will be home soon, mamma."</p>

<p>"What's that to me, Bell? You don't suppose
I shall stay at Hatton, and hear Mrs. Pynsent's
remarks about Ripley, and Clara's folly
in coming to an open rupture with her husband?
The Tom Pynsents should have accepted Hatton
when it was first proposed to them. I shall not
visit there till Anna Maria is mistress of the
property."</p>

<p>"But you will go to poor Clara, mamma."</p>

<p>"What am I to go to Ripley for?&mdash;to see my
daughter ill-treated, or be treated myself with
indifference? Clara had no business to make
herself conspicuous by quarrelling. I wish,
Bell, when you do vouchsafe to talk, that you
would choose better subjects to converse upon.
Your poor father's education has only fitted you
to be a nuisance. I hate girls with books in
their hands, and dulness on their tongues."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Christobelle changed the conversation.</p>

<p>"Mamma, your worsted work looks beautiful
upon that ottoman; I could almost fancy that
rose had perfume, it is so natural."</p>

<p>"Just the opinion of a girl who follows a
man's occupation, instead of her own feminine
amusements: had you any knowledge of work,
you would have thought otherwise." Her
mother gave a glance of disdain at the ottoman.</p>

<p>"I assure you, mamma, I understand all the
stitches. Miss Boscawen taught me."</p>

<p>"One old maid teaching another, Bell."</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall dislike being single,
mamma. Miss Boscawen looks so beautifully
dressed, so clean, not at all like your descriptions
of old maids."</p>

<p>"If you had any anxiety to be established
like your sisters, Bell, you might please and
amuse me in my seclusion. No one comes near
me now, not even Miss Wycherly, who was
always at Wetheral with Julia. I don't understand
it. You might bring about an intimacy
with Frank Kerrison, Bell, and ask him here to
read with you. He will inherit Ripley, you
know."</p>

<p>"Mamma, I don't like Frank Kerrison, he
swears so."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, you matter-of-fact thing: if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
swears now, it does not follow he will always
swear."</p>

<p>"But papa says, it is seldom left off. I
don't like Frank, he is so violent with his
sisters."</p>

<p>"But you would be his wife, not his sister,
child. What stupid notions you have!"</p>

<p>The hall-bell rang violently. Lady Wetheral's
eyes brightened.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Some one has arrived at last to amuse me.
I hope it is Penelope come to ask us to her
marriage. She ought to do so, for Julia's sake."</p>

<p>The door opened, and Clara entered, to their
great astonishment. She seated herself with
perfect coolness.</p>

<p>"There," said she, "now let the brute seek
me in my father's house!"</p>

<p>"My dear Clara, what brings you to Wetheral?&mdash;is
Sir Foster with you?&mdash;will you
dine here?" asked Lady Wetheral, in delighted
accents. "I cannot tell you how a little society
charms me in this dull place. You have made
up that foolish fracas, my love, and you are both
come to dine with me: is that it?"</p>

<p>"I am certainly come to dinner, and to sleep
too," replied Clara, taking up the work which
Christobelle had dropped in surprise. "Where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
is your thimble, Bell? I will finish this sprig for
you."</p>

<p>"But, Sir Foster, my love&mdash;where is Sir
Foster?"</p>

<p>"I really cannot say: perhaps, kicking the
nurse-maids, as I am not at Ripley to stand in
their place."</p>

<p>"Are you alone, then, Clara?"</p>

<p>"I hope so. I mean to be alone for some
time."</p>

<p>"My dear Clara, you surely have not been
quarrelling again!"</p>

<p>"Again! oh, no! it has been one long-continued
quarrel ever since I married!"</p>

<p>"I am really shocked at your conduct, my
dear love. How often I have implored you all
to avoid scenes when you married! My dear
Clara, you must remember my earnest instructions.
This is a sad dereliction from good
taste!"</p>

<p>"You should not have married me to a brute,"
exclaimed Clara, becoming impetuous.</p>

<p>"Clara, I was not at your side, when you
eloped with Sir Foster," cried her mother, in a
vindicating tone.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but you may remember the
means you took to induce me to elope, mamma.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
You did not know the moment; but you were
aware of the intention, brought on by your own
hints and anxieties to see me at Ripley. Bell
can bear witness to your remarks and innuendoes."</p>

<p>"I am sure Bell cannot," replied Lady Wetheral,
in alarm.</p>

<p>"Bell can, though! Bell, I charge you to
reply to my question. Did not my mother induce
me to run away with my brute? Speak
truly."</p>

<p>"You cannot say so, Bell," said Lady Wetheral,
bursting into tears.</p>

<p>"Bell, answer truly!" and Clara dragged her
from her chair, to stand before her. Christobelle
struggled to get free; but Clara grasped
her with a force she could not resist. "Now,
Bell, tell my mother the glaring truth!"</p>

<p>"I will not be questioned&mdash;I will not speak&mdash;let
me go, Clara, let me go!"</p>

<p>"Go, then, stupid fool, too weak to utter the
truth!" Clara released her grasp, and Christobelle
fled to a distant chair, to remain a spectator
of the ensuing scene.</p>

<p>"Clara," said her mother, reproachfully,
"what could induce you to blame <i>me</i>, for your
own impolitic conduct? If I wished to see you
the wife of a man standing high in situation, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
never counselled you to forget the proprieties of
life."</p>

<p>"You held up Sir Foster to my view, as a
match which you prayed for, and desired me
never to relinquish," retorted Clara, with passionate
energy. "You have married me to a
heartless brute, and now you turn against me!"</p>

<p>"No, Clara, I do not deserve that reproach;
your temper is too violent for your peace, or
mine." Her mother wept.</p>

<p>"I know my temper is like the whirlwind,
but you never complained of it, or subdued it!
You only bid me conceal it when Lucy came
here, till I was actually the wife of a monster!
I cannot conceal it now, for it chafes under ill
treatment. Oh, if you had but checked it in
childhood, to meet this extremity!" Clara grew
almost madly passionate and vehement; she
threw herself upon her knees before her weeping
mother. "If ever my misery exceeds my forbearance,
it will be your doing, oh! hard-hearted
mother! You have sold me to a wretch who
will drive me to desperation, and you must answer
for it! My temper is warm&mdash;I know it&mdash;but
any other man would not have made me despise
him so horribly. I have provoked him,
and I <i>will</i> provoke him; but it is your doing, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
I did not understand a man's brutal nature. I
thought they were all like my father!"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral became almost convulsed with
agitation. "Ring for Thompson&mdash;Thompson,
Bell!" Alas! Thompson was no longer at Wetheral;
but Christobelle was acquainted with
her mother's ways, and brought the usual remedies
to her hands. She did not avail herself
of their use; her mind was too deeply occupied
to heed them: she pushed her daughter
aside, without being aware of the action.</p>

<p>"Clara, I never thought a child's reproach
would rise against me! I did not imagine a
daughter could raise her voice against a parent,
who had sought so unceasingly the happiness of
her married life."</p>

<p>"In what way, in what way?" demanded
Clara, throwing herself on the ground with a
movement of despair.</p>

<p>"I secured the luxuries of life to you, Clara."</p>

<p>"Oh, folly, folly!"</p>

<p>"I secured to you a proper position in society,
Clara."</p>

<p>"Oh, folly, folly!" continued Lady Kerrison.</p>

<p>"I was anxious to see you enter life, courted,
admired, and envied, my dear Clara."</p>

<p>"<i>Who</i> admires and envies me?" cried Clara,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
starting to her feet. "<i>Who</i> envies my situation,
or would change places with such a wretched
creature? By the Heaven which witnessed the
sacrifice of my youth and hopes of happiness, I
would willingly exchange with the humblest
woman who breaks stones for her daily bread,
and devours it in peace! Oh, Chrystal, never
marry while you live!"</p>

<p>The exertion of complaint, and the powerful
passions which warred in the soul of Clara, exhausted
her strength after this vehement exposition
of her suffering; and she lay upon the
sofa, like a child who had sobbed itself into silence.
It was a solemn sight to see so young
and fair a creature, so deeply engaged in the
strife of passion and contention; the expression
of her countenance was already tinged with
angry feelings, and her beautiful mouth was
losing its attitude of repose: if such was Lady
Kerrison's vehemence of character at this early
period of her marriage, what would become of
her in after-years?</p>

<p>Clara fell into a doze, which continued till
the hall-bell again announced a visitor. Lady
Wetheral, also, endeavoured to acquire a composure
which would not appear at her call;
Lady Kerrison's reproaches had startled and destroyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
her tranquillity. Her hands trembled
under their efforts to resume their occupation,
and sighs burst from her bosom. Christobelle
was glad the bustle of a fresh arrival drew near
the door, to divert her thoughts from her sister's
sorrow. Clara started from her sleep, at the
sound of approaching voices, and rose from her
couch. The servants announced Sir Foster Kerrison.</p>

<p>Sir Foster walked fiercely towards his lady,
without taking notice of Lady Wetheral or
Christobelle, who stood amazed, as he advanced
to the sofa; he did not even wink his eye.
Clara remained in haughty expectation of his
address, her head thrown back, and her eye
flashing defiance. "Now, sir, are you come to
beard me at Wetheral!" was her indignant exclamation;
"are you come here to prove how
brutally you can treat a woman, even in her
father's house?"</p>

<p>"Go home!" cried Sir Foster. "Go home
this instant!"</p>

<p>"I will never return, if there is a roof elsewhere
to shelter me!" returned his lady. "I
am weary of existence under a tyrant's power."</p>

<p>"You won't? who is master at Ripley?" Sir
Foster raised Clara in his arms, and, in spite of
her resistance, he was carrying her from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
boudoir. Lady Wetheral endeavoured to interfere;
she besought Sir Foster not to commit
himself before the servants&mdash;before the world&mdash;by
using force towards his wife; but he heeded
not her observation, or her prayer. Clara was
borne into the hall, unable to contend with the
grasp which detained her prisoner. In vain she
screamed, "Oh, father, my father, save me!" he
was not within hearing. In vain she vehemently
threatened to plague her husband, till life should
be a burden to him: Sir Foster made no reply.
Before the household, who assembled at the
piercing cries of Lady Kerrison, before the Ripley
servants, who were stationed with the carriage,
did Sir Foster bear his lady to the hall-door,
and, ordering his footmen to their post, Clara
was placed in the carriage by main force. She
struggled violently to regain her liberty, but her
delicate limbs were unequal to the conflict; she
sank back almost fainting with her useless
efforts; and, Sir Foster taking his place by her
side, nodded and winked, and chuckled, as he
exclaimed, "Done it well, by Jove! Jerry,
drive like winking!" The Ripley carriage dashed
furiously down the avenue.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral felt intensely the publicity
which accompanied Sir Foster Kerrison's resumption
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of his wife's society. The action
itself was disagreeable&mdash;must be most offensively
disagreeable to Clara&mdash;but the manner
of the thing, the public display which surrounded
the whole affair, was inexcusable! It
was beyond a doubt now, the affairs of Ripley
were discussed in the servants' halls and dining-rooms
throughout the neighbourhood&mdash;a most
horrible idea! People might be as unhappy as
they pleased, and quarrel whenever they felt
inclined so to do, but it was an offence against
society, to perpetrate little misunderstandings
before the world. Nothing could be in such
wretched taste. Clara was very foolish and impolitic
to irritate a man like Sir Foster, and
blame her for the results. She had always cautioned
Clara and the rest of her girls against
scenes.</p>

<p>The remembrance of her salutary cautions,
however, did not operate upon Lady Wetheral's
nerves, or bring calmness to her mind. Clara's
words rang in her ears; and her figure, as she
knelt in the attitude of upbraiding, glided before
her eyes. She could not forget those piercing
expressions, "If ever my misery exceeds my
forbearance, it will be your doing, oh! hard-hearted
mother!" The voice sounded through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
house, it followed her into the dressing-room;
she complained to Christobelle that it would
haunt her in her sleep, and that her death would
be caused by filial ingratitude, after all her anxieties
to promote her child's welfare. "I am
sure these scenes are enough to destroy me,
Bell, and I think Thompson might have spared
her part in the transaction. She made my dose
of sal-volatile exactly to my taste, and now in
my extremity I dare not touch your mixtures,
for I dare say they would excoriate my throat.
Mrs. Bevan will never be what Thompson was;
she looks perfectly bewildered when I require
any thing. Clara has killed me: ingratitude is,
indeed, hard to bear, and it will disgust me
from making any further sacrifices on my own
part for others. I shall not concern myself
with your marriage, Bell. Marry whom you
please; but, if you marry less well than your
sisters, never come into my presence." Christobelle
promised never to marry without her
concurrence.</p>

<p>"So you all say, and act in defiance when opportunity
offers. Say nothing to your father,
Bell, about Clara; it was lucky he rode to
Shrewsbury this morning; he would have laid
the blame upon me, too; he always lectures me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
now: say nothing about it, pray. What is
that?" Her ladyship started. "Oh, it is that
ungrateful voice; it spoke quite plain to me! I
am sure I shall have a nervous attack, if that
voice haunts me."</p>

<p>Clara's reproaches had sunk deeply into Lady
Wetheral's heart, though she affected to carry
off this impression with bravery of manner. In
vain she took repeated doses of camphor-julep to
still her nerves, and recover a portion of her
spirits; the trembling of her limbs increased,
and she acknowledged it would be impossible to
meet poor Sir John at dinner; Christobelle
must take her place, and invent any excuse she
pleased for her absence, so that the truth was
concealed from her husband. She was on no
account to hint to him the transactions of the
morning. It was fortunate for Christobelle that
her father made few comments upon his lady's
illness during their solitary meal; but his disposition
was perfectly free from suspicion or curiosity,
and conversation turned upon other subjects.
Christobelle was delighted by one piece
of intelligence on his part. The Tom Pynsents
were to arrive in England the following week.
Mrs. Pynsent and Mrs. Hancock were in Lewis's
shop, and they informed him of their instant return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to Hatton. Paris had not amused Tom,
and he was longing to return to England; they
had even come to the resolution of never again
quitting Shropshire. Mrs. Pynsent was full of
bustle and happiness at the idea&mdash;she would
now get Tom back, and thank God all his dogs
were in fine condition&mdash;not a puppy lost. Tom
would find every thing as he left it, and Sal
Hancock must be off to Lea. Mrs. Hancock
winked her eye at her sister's remark.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, Pen, Tom will know a
thing or two, when he comes from France; ten
to one but I get into fashion this time."</p>

<p>"You be hanged, Sally Hancock!"</p>

<p>"They are not so whitewashed in France,
Pen. I'll make a good bet our Tommy has had
a 'cherry amy' by this time."</p>

<p>"None of your surmises, Sally Hancock; you
know I can't bear any thing said about Tom. I'll
be hanged if I take you home for that fib!"</p>

<p>"Faith, you must carry me somewhere,
Pen," replied Mrs. Hancock, coolly; "you can't
leave me and my game-leg here."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, then, about Tom and
'cherry amys.'"</p>

<p>Sir John thought it was time to make his
bow to the ladies, and he quitted the shop, leaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the sisters in high altercation. The quarrels
of Mrs. Pynsent and Mrs. Hancock were fortunately
as short as they were frequent and public.
Ten minutes after Sir John's departure from
Lewis's shop, he saw Mrs. Hancock upon her
sister's arm, walking with great difficulty and in
apparent pain; but both ladies were laughing
immoderately, and attracting the notice of the
passers by from the loudness of their conversation.</p>

<p>Christobelle trusted that Tom Pynsent's return
would operate advantageously upon her
mother's spirits, and assist the recovery of her
tone of mind, which appeared sinking. She could
not understand the extraordinary change which
had taken place in a person naturally so active
and lively. It appeared as though Clara's marriage
had acted as a sedative upon her mental
and physical energies, and numbed their vigour.
She had sunk rapidly into a nervous, solitary
being, unequal to every exertion, indifferent to
her husband's society, and dead to all resources.
Yet was Sir Foster Kerrison the long-coveted
object of her wishes, and every thought of her
heart had been given to the accomplishment of
that most desired union. Clara married Sir
Foster, and obtained Ripley. What then caused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
this lassitude of body and mind? this melancholy
exhibition of energies unemployed? of time
heavily passed in dull complaining, and nervous
misery? Her daughters were highly and
wealthily established; and her views for each
had been promptly and successfully fulfilled.</p>

<p>What <i>could</i> produce such a fearful change in
the graceful Lady Wetheral, once, and so lately
too, the gayest of the gay; ever animated, ever
pleasing, even to those who knew and feared her
matrimonial speculations? Because, all that was
triumphant had fled;&mdash;because all that was
most exciting had passed away. The hopes and
fears which had given zest to life were unfortunately
at rest, and there was nothing now to
lead on the energies, and compel exertion. The
cause was withdrawn, and the effect was fatal to
a happiness which consisted in ceaseless anxiety
to procure establishments for her children. All
solicitude was now ended, and the mind sank,
unemployed, into listlessness. Every thing became
gloomy in its routine; every thing was
conducted in its usual daily forms, but there
was no longer the spirit which gave animation
to ceremony. The shadow still remained, but
the substance had departed, which threw a
mantle of gaiety and brilliance over the proceedings
of Wetheral Castle.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>


<p>Nothing could exceed Tom Pynsent's pleasure
at beholding himself again in England, and at
Hatton. The Wetheral party were summoned
by the warm-hearted, affectionate mother to
attend the arrival of her son, and rejoice over
his "second birth;" and a large party of relatives
were invited to dine at Hatton, and celebrate
his return. Mrs. Pynsent particularly desired
Christobelle might appear upon the occasion.
She thought the young ones had suffered enough
in the matrimonial line; and, as that "poor bit
of a girl was not old enough to be hawked after
the men," she thought the lanky thing ought to
be allowed to enjoy herself for a few years, and
begin her pleasures by rejoicing over Tom's arrival.
Sir John Wetheral decided that Christobelle
should accept the invitation; and his
lady offered no objection, though her daughter
could not feel gratified by her remarks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! go, by all means, Bell, as Mrs. Pynsent
wishes you to meet Anna Maria. You and
your father, of course, must hunt in couples;
your tastes are so similar and so agreeable. I
am much too nervous to join that coarse party.
Of course, Mrs. Hancock will be there; I cannot
sit in Mrs. Hancock's company. Anna
Maria will come to see me some early day. I
must beg of you not to colour up so vulgarly,
when any one addresses you, and try not to sit
down to any one's table so hungry and thirsty as
you manage to do at home. Pray, eat a meal
before you set off, to prevent that dreadfully
famished look, Bell."</p>

<p>"I am always hungry with exercise, mamma."</p>

<p>"Nothing can be so insupportably in bad
taste. I shall not be at Hatton to shudder
under your voracious <i>exposé</i>, but I shall imagine
you committing a thousand errors. I hope the
Farnboroughs will not be present to observe my
youngest daughter. I suppose I must be content
to remain solitary, and submit to Bevan's
attentions for that day. My daughters marrying
so early has left me a poor, solitary being."</p>

<p>Christobelle was anxious to be useful, and she
tried to look cheerful, as she exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will remain at home then, mamma, if you
please."</p>

<p>"Not as a <i>companion</i>, Bell. I cannot fancy
you presume to offer yourself as my companion.
Oh, no! go with your father, by all means."</p>

<p>Christobelle was accustomed to be treated
with petulance; it was vain to hope for any
change for the better, and her delight at the
idea of her visit sheltered her heart under this
blow. How wearying it was to endeavour to
please, and yet to prove ever unsuccessful! But
the visit to Hatton would balance much annoyance:
she looked forward with intense eagerness
to the first dinner engagement which had
varied her existence; and she felt doubly grateful
that her first appearance in public should
take place without the fearful accompaniment of
her mother's presence. Her father was sure to
be kind and encouraging. How slowly did the
days appear to pass by, ere she could be dressed
for the festivities of Hatton!</p>

<p>A select number of friends assembled at Hatton
on the eventful morning of Tom Pynsent's
arrival. Sir John Wetheral and Christobelle
arrived first, and the Wycherlys, Charles Spottiswoode,
and Mrs. Hancock followed in their
own order. <i>They</i> were allowed to witness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
"Tom's" re-entrance into Hatton&mdash;they alone
were to witness the restless joy and expectation
which revelled in Mrs. Pynsent's heart and eyes.
None other possessed a claim to intrude upon
her son's happiness, or divide with herself the
first words, the look, and the affectionate embrace
of her only child.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent wandered round the rooms, and
perambulated the Hall, as the time stole on towards
the expected moment of meeting. The
hounds were stationed in the park, with the
whipper-in, to greet their master and do him
honour, by baying deep and loud as he drew
towards his home. The men were arrayed in
their hunting costume by Mrs. Pynsent's desire,
that her own dear boy might be surrounded by
all he best loved, in the style he most approved,
"for, married or unmarried, her Tom would
love the dogs and his old mother to the end of
time." Mrs. Hancock sat silent and quiet till
her sister's restless movements roused her attention.</p>

<p>"I say, Pen, you've got the staggers."</p>

<p>"How can I be still, Sally Hancock, when I
am expecting Tom? I can't sit like Bobby,
there. Look at Bobby, sitting with his legs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
crossed, and his face as calm as if Tom was no
son of his."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hancock winked upon the company as
she called out to Mr. Pynsent:&mdash;"I say, Bob
Pynsent, Pen may have&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent turned quickly upon her sister.</p>

<p>"Sally Hancock, you be quiet now. You
know Tom and Bobby, too, won't endure your
jokes. If you begin joking, you will be sent
back to Lea before Tom arrives."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hancock was not in the least degree
ruffled by the threat.</p>

<p>"None of your great guns, Pen. I'm as silent
as a mouse. I thought I should never be silent
again though, when we caught Charley Snooks
in the booth that race-day."</p>

<p>"Sally Hancock, what things you do remember!
Shall we ever forget squeezing into the
pit of the play-house, and finding Polly Sydenham
twigging us from the side-box?"</p>

<p>Again both sisters were plunged into a recital
of past levities, and were laughing immoderately,
when the hounds sent forth their cry,
and ran in full chase round the swell of the
park which fronted the entrance to Hatton.
They were laid on the scent of a red-herring,
which had been previously dragged round the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
knoll, the moment the travelling-carriage entered
the lodge. This was Mrs. Pynsent's particular
command. She was resolved to celebrate her
son's arrival in a manner most consonant to his
tastes and feelings, and her heart prompted this
mode of testifying her delight at his return. The
cry of the dogs was a signal to rush towards the
hall-door, and Tom Pynsent was waving his
hat, and tally-hooing with all his might, as the
carriage tore up the serpentine road from the
lodge-gates. Mrs. Pynsent was in ecstacies of
joy.</p>

<p>"Here, hallo, Bill! fetch your master's horse
out in a minute; he has been saddled these two
hours. I know what my Tom will do; his old
mother knows him well. Jack Ball! off with
you, and turn the colts into the park. Stir
along, boys! Look at him&mdash;bless him! Come,
Sally Hancock, let us have a cheer for Tom."</p>

<p>Sally Hancock was nothing loth; she shouldered
her stick with the air of a corporal, and
both ladies startled their companions by uttering
a loud and protracted huzza. Tom Pynsent
answered the shout. His body was half way
through the carriage window, as he continued
waving and hurraing to the scene before him.
At last the carriage drew up, and Mrs. Pynsent's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
arms once more encircled her darling son. She
hung round his neck entranced.</p>

<p>"My blessed Tom, my only and sweet boy,
your poor mother is happy to get you back again.
The dogs and colts, Tom, are well; the hounds
all well, my Tommy. Your poor mother has
looked well after them. And there's your father,
waiting, Tom, to shake hands&mdash;and here's Sally
Hancock!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent withdrew her arms reluctantly,
and her son advanced to shake hands with his
father. Mr. Pynsent's mild countenance shone
with pleasure as he congratulated him upon his
return, and confessed how much he had missed
his society. Tom Pynsent was in tearing spirits
at finding himself upon Hatton ground, listening
to affectionate speeches delivered in pure English
again. He shook hands with every one, and
saluted every lady.</p>

<p>"How do you all do? How do you do, my
fat aunt, Hancock? How do you do, Pen?
Why, Spottiswoode, have you waited for me to
be your bridegroom's man? How do you do,
Sir John? I have brought home my little
woman, quite rosy, you see&mdash;here she is. So,
little Miss with the long name, how are you?
Upon my soul, you all look 'grass!'" Tom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Pynsent held his hand to his mouth, and turned
again to the hall-door.</p>

<p>"Tally-ho, there!&mdash;bring 'em round, Barton!"</p>

<p>The saddled horse was trotted up, and Tom
Pynsent sprang upon his back. He waved his
hand to the company.</p>

<p>"I use no ceremony.&mdash;One gallop round the
park, and I'll be amongst you again. Tally-ho,
there. Tally-ho!"</p>

<p>The mettled steed plunged and reared under
the tightened rein, while his master spoke; but,
in an instant, he dashed from the door, and the
horse and his rider were seen flying down the
park, followed by the whole complement of dogs
and attendants. Mrs. Pynsent gazed after her
son with proud delight.</p>

<p>"I say, Bobby, there he goes! Didn't I tell
you he would love to see his dogs round him?
Bless him, his mother knew his tastes. There's
his little wife gone off with her father! She
does not stay to look at Tom. <i>She</i> doesn't care
for his whims, Sally Hancock&mdash;how should a
Wetheral care for any thing?&mdash;I don't, and I
can't, abide a woman who is indifferent to Tom's
whims."</p>

<p>"Don't mob the Wetherals, Pen; it's only the
old lady: <i>they</i> can't help their mother."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"How well Tom sits a horse!" continued Mrs.
Pynsent, who could not withdraw her eyes, or
mind, from one object, for a moment. "There
he goes, neck or nothing!"</p>

<p>Mr. Pynsent reminded his lady that Anna
Maria was in the drawing-room, and that she
had scarcely welcomed her. Mrs. Pynsent snapped
her fingers.</p>

<p>"Tom is my son, and I'll attend to no one
till he returns. Pen is with the young woman.
I won't stir till Tom comes back. If the young
woman loved Tom as I love him, she would be
watching him in his delight there, looking so
handsome and happy! I don't like her for leaving
Tom!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hancock was quite of her opinion, and
Mrs. Pynsent was softened by her coalition.</p>

<p>"Sally Hancock, you shall dine here, to-day,
if you will promise to be quiet."</p>

<p>"Now, Pen, what do I <i>ever</i> say?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid of you, Sally Hancock. You
know Tom and Bob won't bear your remarks.
You know you never were fit for ladies' society,
after you married that Hancock."</p>

<p>"What was the matter with Hancock, except
he was tipsy or angry, Pen?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you promise to be quiet, if I ask you
to stay dinner, Sally Hancock?"</p>

<p>"I'll try for it, Pen."</p>

<p>"I believe you must return to Lea, after all,
Sally Hancock. Tom will be very angry: he
can't endure your remarks."</p>

<p>"Fiddle diddle, I'll be very good, to-day: I
will, <i>indeed</i>, Pen."</p>

<p>Christobelle lingered at the hall-door, to enjoy
the cheering sight of the hounds, and to watch
Tom Pynsent's enjoyment. When that display
was lost to her view, she flew again into the
drawing-room, and seated herself at Anna Maria's
feet. Christobelle gazed at her sister, and
fancied four months' absence had affected a
change. Mrs. Tom Pynsent spoke with volubility,
and her manner was less timid and
pleasing. A very high colour was upon her
once pale cheeks, and her eyes were unnaturally
bright and sparkling: altogether, Christobelle
thought her sister Pynsent very much changed.
When she had again received a salutation from
her lips, and a brief compliment upon her growth
and appearance, Anna Maria continued her discourse.</p>

<p>"Oh, I liked every thing exceedingly at Paris,
as far as society was concerned: every thing eatable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
shocking&mdash;but the Count de Nolis assured
me the march of improvement had begun, and
would be very evident when he returned. Tom
did not like Paris. He felt the want of sporting,
and those sort of noisy pursuits which are disgusting
to the Parisians. The Count de Nolis
introduced us to many delightful French families.
I must confess I did not like it at first,
but I was sorry to quit Paris. English customs
are so wearisome, after the ease of French
society!"</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral looked surprised at Anna
Maria's sentiments, and he glanced his eye upon
Christobelle with an anxious expression, as she
sat gazing at her sister. Miss Wycherly was
entertained beyond expression by the change in
her manners, and amused herself by calling forth
Anna Maria's remarks. She inquired who the
Count de Nolis was, who figured so much in
their train.</p>

<p>"The Count! Oh, the dearest and liveliest
creature you ever saw. He is engaged to pay
Tom a visit, or rather myself, for I don't think
Tom liked him. He will visit us in the autumn.
I have been obliged to bring a French maid
home, to dress me, because a lady's maid here
is only fit to dress an English woman."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you renounced the title of English
woman, Anna Maria?" asked her father, gravely.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, papa. I shall always be English;
but Félicé has such a way of blending colours,
and making up dresses!&mdash;You shall judge for
yourself. Is there a party, to-day, at dinner;
or, are we to have a <i>soirée</i>?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent and her son entered the room,
followed by Mrs. Hancock, as Anna Maria spoke.
Tom Pynsent advanced to his lady.</p>

<p>"Well, little woman, chatting away!&mdash;Do
you see, Sir John, how rosy we are by our trip?
I wish you could have seen her talking and
chirping to De Nolis. You would have been
surprised."</p>

<p>"My heavens! What a couple of painted
cheeks!" exclaimed Mrs. Pynsent, in a tone of
horror.</p>

<p>"A couple of what?" cried her son, quickly.
Anna Maria became perceptibly distressed: her
husband surveyed her with looks of perfect satisfaction
and admiration, entirely unconscious
of the cause of her agitation.</p>

<p>"Yes, she is rosy enough now, bless her! I
am glad France has done such wonders for my
wife: she looked as healthy as the best of them
in Paris. De Nolis advised her to rouge at first.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
No, none of that, says I. No wife of mine shall
paint, like Jezebal. I was right, you see, for
her cheeks soon grew blooming as a rose&mdash;didn't
they?" he added, chucking her under the chin.</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly smiled. Anna Maria recovered
her self-possession, and began a tirade against
English costume, without answering her mother-in-law's
observation. She spoke so much more
rapidly than "Miss Wetheral" had ever spoken.
She seemed to have acquired so much alertness
of speech and manner&mdash;so much forwardness in
making remarks&mdash;her eyes were so bright, and
her cheeks bore such a deep <i>couleur de rose</i>, that
Christobelle sat in fixed attention, watching her
movements. She thought Anna Maria remarkably
improved in person; she admired the vivacity
of her countenance, and manner; but she
was no longer the simple and elegant Anna Maria,
so gentle and so mild&mdash;that many opinions
had decided her to be insipid. Every one appeared
watching her with nearly equal surprise
and attention. Mrs. Pynsent stood with her
arms akimbo, and her eyes rooted upon her son;
but the others were all earnestly listening to
Mrs. Tom Pynsent, as she commented upon the
dreadful <i>tournure</i> of the English fashionist.</p>

<p>"I assure you, Penelope, you could discern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
an Englishwoman the instant she appeared in
the street. Her walk is firm and good, but
her shawl and bonnet is only English. I had
such a lecture from De Nolis! He made me
put aside all my Shropshire habiliments, and
I was obliged to be entirely refitted by Le Boi."</p>

<p>"Well, by Jove!" cried Tom Pynsent, "that
was not <i>my</i> doing: De Nolis was the ladies'
favourite, and he turned my little wife's head
about dress. I liked her just as well in her stout
silk pelisse, that put me in mind of Wetheral
and Shrewsbury."</p>

<p>Anna Maria playfully placed her hand upon
her husband's lips.</p>

<p>"Do be quiet, Tom, and don't be so very
English."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent kissed the little hand which enforced
silence, and held it in his own capacious
palm. Anna Maria drew her chair closer to her
husband, and, leaning her head against his side
as he stood near, continued her discourse.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, papa, I liked Paris dearly,
but Tom complained of this, and disliked that.
He would not eat his dinner, because it was
stewed frogs; he said he would not eat frogs&mdash;he
would not drink sour wine&mdash;he would not do
any thing to be comfortable."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wanted to come home in a fortnight," said
Tom, still playing with his lady's hand; "but
my little wife would not listen to me. De
Nolis and herself led me a pretty dance, I can
tell you. Hang me, if I understood their jargon
in Paris, and I only knew Jack Smith, and Tom
Biddulph, to talk with. Spottiswoode was at
Florence; De Nolis jabbered away every where
with my wife; while I and Jack amused ourselves
with quizzing Biddulph. My wife had
never any leisure to write home, or talk to <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"My dear Tom!"</p>

<p>"No, I vow you were always laughing and
talking with that French fellow, and his cursed
broken English."</p>

<p>"But who ever saw me without <i>you</i>, Tom?
and what pleasure should I have had, if you had
not been close to me?"</p>

<p>Anna Maria clasped her husband's hand with
an air and manner so affectionate, that all hearts
present felt assured of her domestic happiness.
Her father's expressive face became enlivened,
and Mrs. Pynsent almost involuntarily gave
Anna Maria a startling slap upon her shoulder,
as she cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm a happy woman, since my Tom is loved
by us all alike. I tell you what, young woman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
I fancied you could not love my son, because
you did not remain to witness his delight with
the hounds; but now, I see you <i>do</i> love him,
though you will never understand his old
mother's fondness."</p>

<p>Anna Maria started at the blow, but she held
out her hand to Mrs. Pynsent, and assured her
every one must love Tom who lived with him.
He had lingered in Paris against his will to
please <i>her</i>. He had suffered every disagreeable
annoyance in silence to give <i>her</i> satisfaction;
and Tom had never objected to any whim or
amusement required by herself. How then
could she do otherwise than love him beyond
every earthly creature?</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent looked all astonishment during
the dialogue which passed between his wife and
mother. It did not occur to him that his Anna
Maria's love was less sincere than his mother's
affection: and as to his wife's recapitulation of
his virtues, "Who the devil married a woman
unless he meant to indulge her?"</p>

<p>This little scene, and Anna Maria's public testimony
in favour of her husband's kindness had
great effects, however, naturally and unsuspiciously
as it had been spoken. Mrs. Pynsent
was charmed by her daughter-in-law's simple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and affectionate statement, and she was the
head-piece at Hatton. From that moment
every good feeling was enlisted on Anna Maria's
side by Mrs. Pynsent; and her fondness for her
daughter threatened to equal the affection she
bore her son. She told her sister, Hancock,
Anna Maria might paint her cheeks as scarlet
as the Babylonian woman's gown if she liked,
<i>she</i> would raise no objection. She cared for
nothing but Tom, and if his wife loved him and
made him happy, she might paint and talk of
that Frenchman as much as she pleased.</p>

<p>The dinner-party appeared to Christobelle's
eyes the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of human happiness. She
was attended to by every person; and no one appeared
startled by her awkwardness, or the vulgarity
of her manners. Lady Wetheral's searching
eye was not present; her severe remarks
did not sound in her ear, and she enjoyed profound
peace of mind and body. No subsequent
dinner-party ever equalled that day in its effects
upon her head and heart. She sat between her
dear father and Charles Spottiswoode, enjoying
their conversation, and looking upon happy
faces. Miss Wycherly's lively spirits were ever
amusing, and her spirited dialogues with her
cousin Tom appeared to Christobelle to be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
concentrated essence of wit and cleverness: she
laughed unrestrainedly and joyously throughout
the evening.</p>

<p>Sir Foster Kerrison and Clara were among
the dinner guests, with Lucy. Clara's expression
of figure and countenance was that of extreme
hauteur, and she did not look at, or address
Sir Foster during the evening. Sir Foster
himself had regained his usual "<i>far niente</i>"
since his last appearance. When the gentlemen
returned into the drawing-room upon the
summons to tea, Sir Foster deposited himself
in an arm-chair, without addressing any of his
neighbours. He looked on the amusements
and the different groupes with a smile, as he sat
stretched to his utmost length; his eye winked
with tolerable rapidity, and a subdued chuckle
every now and then evinced that his mind received
pleasure from some part of the conversation
which reached his ear at intervals. Clara
alone preserved a haughty silence to all, and
appeared cold and indignant. Lucy Kerrison,
whose age approached nearest that of Christobelle,
sat by her after tea, and confided to her
hearing the miseries of Ripley.</p>

<p>"I declare, Miss Wetheral, Ripley is more
solitary and disagreeable than ever. Papa and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Clara do quarrel so dreadfully, that we cannot
expect any one to come near the house." Here
Lucy lowered her voice. "There was such a
scene the day papa brought Clara away from
Wetheral! Oh! Miss Chrystal, what dreadful
things they said to each other! Papa, you
know, is very violent, though he looks so still
and quiet, and Clara was very provoking. Papa
struck her once, and yet she would not be
silent; she was very insolent, and papa threatened
to turn her out of the house before the butler.
It was very dreadful. Well, Clara ran away,
and papa, you know, brought her back. Good
gracious! how Clara did abuse him in the hall
before all the servants! Papa only laughed
then. I assure you they quarrelled this morning
worse than ever; papa forgets as soon
as it is over, but Clara keeps worry, worry,
worry, till another quarrel is begun. I wish
some one would ask me to stay with them:
Lady Wetheral promised to have me with her;
but I have never been asked since Clara married
papa."</p>

<p>Christobelle mentioned her mother's illness,
and her lowness of spirits.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry. Ripley is nothing now
but a scene of quarrels. I was not aware of
Clara's temper at Wetheral. I fancied her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
quick-feeling, but not violent. I assure you
she makes papa worse, by her provoking manner
and her determination to have the last word.
What can it signify who has the first or last
word in a quarrel?"</p>

<p>Christobelle was equally surprised at Lucy's
description of Clara's talents for tormenting.
She knew her disposition was very warm, and
that she could be roused into violence; but she
had never evinced a disposition to provoke.
Christobelle had always considered her too
proud to descend into wanton provocation, and
too indifferent to her husband, to endure altercation
after the cause had passed away, which
provoked resentment. Clara's worst feelings
were perhaps roused into action by Sir Foster's
violence. Had her good genius interfered, to
prevent the unhappy union of two beings so ill
suited to each other, Clara had been a happier
and better woman, and Sir Foster a more
respectable and intelligent neighbour and friend.
Christobelle looked at Clara as Lucy proceeded
in her remarks, and could perceive her brow
lowered, and her handsome mouth compressed.
The cause of the morning's quarrel, as detailed
by Lucy, was indeed frivolous, and wretched in
its folly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"That horrible fishmonger was at Ripley this
morning, and Clara began vexing papa with the
old affair over again&mdash;good gracious! how she
did irritate him! Well, papa never forgets to
revenge himself at the moment, so he went into
the servants' hall, and brought a large fish into
the sitting-room&mdash;goodness, how it smelled!
Papa chuckled very much, so I knew he was
preparing for mischief; and he threw the creature
into Clara's lap, upon her beautiful silk
dress&mdash;upon my honour! Clara told him he
was a brute, too brutish for his own servants'
hall; and there was such a dialogue! I ran away;
but the servants listened at the door, and heard
it all. Pelham says it was a proper Billingsgate
on papa's side, and only just 'over the way' on
Clara's part. Papa has forgot it now; but
Clara will remember it for a month to come."</p>

<p>This was a sad prospect: Clara, so young and
inexperienced, was already wedded to dissention,
and beginning her young career of life in
bitterness! Clara, full of spirits, and energy of
character, was deepening the shades of evil, by
an unwomanly and improper contention with
the husband she had chosen against her father's
wishes. What must be the consequence of
powerful passions constantly in collision between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Sir Foster and Lady Kerrison, since their early
matrimony was so discordant? Miss Wycherly
spoke anxiously and feelingly upon the subject
to Anna Maria.</p>

<p>"This is a fearful match, my dear Mrs. Tom,
and Ripley will be the grave of your sister's
respectability. The Kerrisons' quarrels are
already the topic of conversation at every table
where your family are not present. Can you
advise Lady Kerrison to be patient?&mdash;will she
bear any interference?"</p>

<p>Anna Maria hoped all things, when they were
more settled at Hatton. Tom would perhaps
interfere a little, and if any one could bring
things about, she was sure it would be Tom, he
had such a peculiarly agreeable manner. She
would speak to Tom upon the subject.</p>

<p>Clara's eyes glanced towards the groupe, and
she rose to join them.</p>

<p>"What are you all chatting about so earnestly?"
she observed, as they made room for
her. She seated herself between her sisters.
"Go on with your subject: what was it?"</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly answered for all.</p>

<p>"We were talking of matrimony, Lady
Kerrison."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Clara's eyes sparkled with a thousand fires,
as she slightly waved her hand.</p>

<p>"Let me continue it with you, Miss Wycherly,
for I am able to speak from experience.
Who is counsel for that state? I am decidedly
upon the other side."</p>

<p>"We were only observing how much power
the woman possessed over the man's mind, by
gentleness, patience, and soft words, under
trials, my dear Lady Kerrison."</p>

<p>"Gentleness! patience!" remarked Clara,
with a laugh of disdain,&mdash;"ask my brute any
thing patiently!"</p>

<p>Anna Maria caught her hand, as she extended
it scornfully towards Sir Foster.</p>

<p>"Now, dear Clara, don't be energetic. I will
ask Tom what he thinks. Tom always says
things so agreeably."</p>

<p>"I will say what is true, if it proves disagreeable,"
replied Clara, withdrawing her hand
from Anna Maria's light grasp, and again pointing
attention, by a graceful movement, to Sir
Foster, who sat silently winking his eye. "If
there is a creature born to be a blessing to
woman&mdash;patient, gentle, and interesting&mdash;look
at <i>that</i> man."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Foster winked violently. Anna Maria
bent towards Lady Kerrison.</p>

<p>"Hush, my dear sister; do not offend Sir
Foster, I beseech you; pray do not attract people's
notice. My dear Clara, forbear!"</p>

<p>"Nay, he is attractive enough in himself,"
observed Lady Kerrison, in raised tones; "no
words of mine can exalt him higher among the
brute creation, than he stands by nature."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tom Pynsent became alarmed at her sister's
audacity, and she signed to her husband,
who was seated by Mrs. Tyndal, to join the little
circle. He advanced immediately.</p>

<p>"Well, my little wife, what are you wishing?
The dear Count is not here, is he? therefore you
want <i>me</i> among you."</p>

<p>"Now, be quiet, Tom." Mrs. Tom Pynsent
looked round to discover a disengaged chair: her
husband saw the inquiring look, and he seated
himself upon the carpet.</p>

<p>"Well, now, what was I summoned for?"</p>

<p>"My dear Tom," replied his lady, smiling,
"I particularly wish you to give me your opinion
upon matrimony before the young ladies here
assembled."</p>

<p>"<i>My</i> matrimony, if you please," observed
Lady Kerrison&mdash;"you are requested to take a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
comprehensive view of <i>my</i> matrimony." She
looked haughtily towards Sir Foster, who sat
within hearing. "There sits my animal: shall
we decide upon the species?"</p>

<p>"Hush, Clara, hush!" softly whispered Mrs.
Tom Pynsent.</p>

<p>"My dear Lady Kerrison!" burst from the
lips of Miss Wycherly.</p>

<p>"Every one has a name and a place," continued
Lady Kerrison, heedless of all caution and
counsel. "Pray, Tom Pynsent, assert your
opinions as plainly as I do mine, and tell me
what a mother deserves, who weds her young
and unsuspecting child to a brute, without contemplating
her fate in prospect? Pray, Tom
Pynsent, what is the conclusion of that fate?
Will it rest in dull misery, or will the indignant
spirit burst its fetters?"</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent affected ignorance of Lady Kerrison's
meaning: he saw Miss Wycherly and
Lucy Kerrison cast looks of alarm at Sir Foster,
who was winking very rapidly; he saw, also,
tears springing to the eyes of his wife&mdash;something
must be done: he rose hastily.</p>

<p>"Anna Maria, this is a very <i>English</i> party,
to your little trumpery, new-set taste! Your
French Count would have lectured you for sitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
so long in one spot. Come, Chrystal, and
Lucy, let us have a round game or a country-dance.
Who will play us a country-dance?
Pen, rattle the keys for us."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly was eager to break up the
conference, and she played country-dances with
great spirit: five couple were therefore soon
arranged, and Christobelle was led forth by
Charles Spottiswoode. When they reached the
termination of the set, Mr. Spottiswoode addressed
his partner with an air of mystery, and
inquired, in low tones, if she had lately heard of
or from Bedinfield. Christobelle could give no
satisfactory intelligence. A letter had certainly
been received at Wetheral lately, but she had
not been made acquainted with its contents.
Mr. Spottiswoode's reply was very complimentary
to Christobelle: she felt it exquisitely.</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral, I address you as no common
person; and I feel assured a young lady,
who has been the companion of Sir John Wetheral,
must be prudent beyond her years. Penelope
has never received any reply to several letters
addressed to Lady Ennismore, and I am
anxious to understand the cause. Your sister
is not ill, I hope?"</p>

<p>Christobelle was unable to answer even that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
simple question; she knew nothing, and had
heard nothing with reference to the Ennismores.</p>

<p>"It is very extraordinary!" was Mr. Spottiswoode's
quick reply, but nothing more was said,
for they were again indefatigably engaged in
dancing, till eleven o'clock, when Sir John Wetheral
approached his daughter, and advised her
to rest till the carriage was announced. As she
seated herself, according to his wish, Christobelle
heard Mrs. Pynsent speaking to Mrs. Tyndal
with some vehemence.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, there will be a dreadful
blow-up soon: I went to see Sally Hancock into
the pony-carriage, and who should be in the
hall but those two people abusing each other.
That matchmaking woman has a thousand sins
to answer for: she will pay for all this, Jane
Tyndal, in the next world!"</p>

<p>Christobelle felt assured the Kerrisons were
the party in question. Her eyes sought them,
but they were not in either of the drawing-rooms.
She turned to Mrs. Pynsent in terror,
and inquired for Clara.</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear, they have killed each other
by this time, as far as intentions can go. They
were fighting in the hall half an hour ago."</p>

<p>Christobelle turned pale with distress, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Mrs. Pynsent, whose heart was as kind as her
manners and address were abrupt, pitied her sufferings.
She put her hand gently upon Christobelle's
shoulder, and spoke with emphasis.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> can't help it, my poor girl; <i>you</i> need
not vex yourself: it will all come home to the
right person, but that won't be you. Only take
care you are not the next sacrifice, and sell yourself
for money at people's bidding."</p>

<p>"Oh! Mrs. Pynsent," cried Christobelle,
"Where is papa?"</p>

<p>"Here, come with me, young lady, and I'll
take you to your father. Remember every word
in your heart of hearts which <i>he</i> utters." Mrs.
Pynsent put Christobelle's arm within her own,
and continued, as they quitted the room, "Some
of her young ones have turned out well, in spite
of her. I hope that will tell for her hereafter.
Don't fret, now, and make your poor
father wish himself at Old Nick: he'll want
comfort at Wetheral, and you must comfort him.
Here, Sir John, I've brought your good girl to
you: don't let her marry in a hurry&mdash;ware
sheep! There, take her into your care, and hide
her for the next seven years."</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral received his daughter with
smiling pleasure, and they proceeded to make
their adieus to the remaining company. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Tom Pynsents were engaged to spend the following
day at Wetheral, and Mrs. Pynsent invited
herself to accompany them. She had no intention
of leaving Tom, just as he was returned from
outlandish places. It might disturb the family
party at Wetheral, but she liked to watch him
enjoying the good roast beef of Old England and
home-brewed ale again, and she would follow
him to Old Nick, to see him looking so jolly and
happy. "Bobby might have Sally Hancock to
keep him company; he did not object to her
when he was alone."</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral particularly requested the
pleasure of Mr. Pynsent's company to complete
the family circle.</p>

<p>"Oh! well, I'll tell him what you say," replied
Mrs. Pynsent. "Bobby has been snoring
these two hours: he can't bear late hours at all.
We shall do very well without him to-morrow,
for he only sits licking his lips. Bobby never
shone much&mdash;but I'll give your message. Sally
Hancock will take very good care of him: it's a
treat to her, you know."</p>

<p>The Wetherals' farewells were rather lengthy,
for they had many friends to hold converse with.
Miss Wycherly hovered round them for some
time, as if she had some disclosure to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
which required effort. She suddenly caught Sir
John's hand as he was quitting the room, and
spoke quickly, "Have you heard from Bedinfield
lately?"</p>

<p>"Not very lately; why do you appear so
anxious, my dear Miss Wycherly?"</p>

<p>"I am very uncomfortable about Julia," she
replied: "I have written three letters without
receiving any reply. I am sure the Dowager is
there; and I am equally sure she separates Julia
from her friends. Julia always loved her friends,
and there is something wrong when a woman is
compelled to drop her old companions. It is
not Julia's fault; I'll stake my existence upon
Julia's true heart: there is double dealing somewhere,
Sir John."</p>

<p>Sir John expressed his intention of visiting
Bedinfield the following week, and Christobelle
was to accompany him. He would be the bearer
of a letter from Miss Wycherly with pleasure.
Miss Wycherly's mind was greatly relieved.</p>

<p>"Oh! if you go, Sir John, all will be well. I
shall hear the truth from you, and you will find
how unchanged dear Julia is. Tell her, from
me, that my love and gratitude is unchangeable,
and that my home is her home for ever and ever.
Tell her I care not for her silence, because it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
not <i>her</i> doing; and though we may never more
meet, she will be Julia Wetheral, as freshly and
fondly my friend, as when she married a man who
could not deserve her. Tell her this from me,
Sir John."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly passed on with her lover, and
the Wetherals entered their carriage in silence.
Sir John sighed heavily, and did not enter into
any conversation with his daughter during their
drive home: doubtless there was bitterness in
his thoughts. Christobelle lost all painful recollections
of the emotion caused by Mrs. Pynsent's
conversation, in pleasing remembrance of the
pleasures of the day. She had enjoyed herself
with the pure, unalloyed happiness which attends
youth, ere it is pursued by care, and before it
endures disappointment. She considered that
day as the very happiest portion of her life. She
had been kindly and hospitably welcomed by
every one, and not a word of reproach or disgust
had been levelled at her. Every one seemed
delighted to see her eat and dance, to her heart's
content. Nothing could surpass the pleasure of
that day&mdash;nothing had ever equalled it!</p>

<p>Sir John parted with his daughter in the hall.
He kissed her, as usual, but his voice was melancholy,
and the parting short.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good night, my love&mdash;I am going to my
study."</p>

<p>"Good night, dear papa!"</p>

<p>Sir John turned away, and Christobelle listened
to his step, as it echoed through the hall, till he
closed the chapel-door behind him. She then
retired to her own room, and slept soundly, in
spite of anticipations of lectures from her mother
upon supposed improprieties committed at
Hatton.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>


<p>Lady Wetheral was extremely disconcerted
by the knowledge of Mrs. Pynsent's intended
visit for the day. The hour of breakfast passed
slowly and miserably to Christobelle, who bore
the whole burden of her petulance, and gave
offence by the silence with which she hoped to
dispel her irritability. "She was not at all like
her other girls. Clara was warm in her temper,
but she had always something sharp or witty
to say. Christobelle was the dullest creature
she had ever been doomed to sit in company
with. Thompson was a great loss, poor dear
silly woman; the best creature in the world,
and the greatest fool for marrying a man
who could not settle something upon her. If
Christobelle would have the kindness to inform
her how Clara looked, she would be extremely
obliged by the information. Perhaps that was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a subject on which she might condescend to
speak."</p>

<p>Christobelle told her mother all she had seen
and heard; and how fearful she was, that another
dispute had arisen between the Kerrisons,
which would increase Clara's violence. Lady
Wetheral smiled incredulously.</p>

<p>"Clara will soon find herself no match for Sir
Foster, and then she must yield by degrees.
One or other must domineer, and the battle will
be short: Clara will feel compelled to command
her temper in time, and all this nonsense will be
forgotten. People always forget the faults of
the rich. Clara must give a splendid ball when
it is blown over. How did Anna Maria appear
to like being a guest at Hatton?"</p>

<p>"She was so happy and agreeable."</p>

<p>"She is very unlike her mother, then. I
never would visit Wetheral till your father's
tiresome old mother died, and Christobelle followed
her example. I expect to hear your sister
designated 'Mrs. Tom' every where. Country
places are so second-rate in their customs! I
hope no one will be guilty of such bad taste before
<i>me</i>."</p>

<p>Christobelle had nothing to bring forward
upon any subject which she considered likely to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
amuse; and, was therefore, again silent. Her
mother patted the table a few seconds.</p>

<p>"Was Mrs. Hancock at dinner yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma."</p>

<p>"And how did she behave?"</p>

<p>"She was quite silent."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Pynsent is tolerated, because her position
in life raises her among the highest of the
land; but Mrs. Hancock is unfit for ladies' society:&mdash;I
was going to say, for female association;
but she does not often intrude. Miss
Wycherly is a softened likeness of Mrs. Pynsent.
There is great insolence in such marked
bluntness of manners; one only meets with it
in retired country places."</p>

<p>Another long pause.</p>

<p>"Your father talks of visiting Bedinfield next
week, and he means to intrude you there. I
shall send for poor dear Isabel and her child,
I think."</p>

<p>Christobelle was all astonishment. What!
summon the Brierly party, whom she always deprecated!
Her surprise was visible in her
countenance.</p>

<p>"Any thing very extraordinary, Bell, in
wishing to see my daughter? I wish you would
endeavour to suppress impertinence in your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
looks and motions, before you leave home.
What are you sitting there for? Pray retire to
your occupations."</p>

<p>Christobelle went into her father's study&mdash;that
sanctum sanctorum for painful feelings, and
mortified spirits, and there she remained till
the Hatton carriage arrived. She had a long
and serious conversation with her kind parent
upon many subjects. He spoke most feelingly
upon the distress of mind he endured, respecting
Clara's conduct and destiny. He had suspected
at Hatton that the Kerrisons were not upon
speaking terms; and, though Sir Foster was
not the man to whom he would commit the care
of a daughter, yet he feared that Clara's turbulent
disposition increased her own misery, and
defied her husband's control. He besought his
youthful daughter to pray without ceasing for a
mild and teachable spirit, that her future days
might not be steeped in misery. He pointed
out the worldly and avaricious feelings which
had induced Clara to marry; and which he
feared would wreck the peace of Lady Ennismore.</p>

<p>Lord Ennismore and Sir Foster Kerrison
were selfish men&mdash;men who cared for their <i>own</i>
pleasures, not for the happiness of those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
lived with them. What had Clara reaped from
her connexion with the Kerrison family?&mdash;Contention
and disgust. What had Julia gained by
an early removal from her family? He firmly
believed she was a victim to the strongly imperious
and fascinating Lady Ennismore, who was
jealous of any influence over her son's mind,
and who would not endure a rival in her power.</p>

<p>Christobelle listened to her father's anxieties
in sorrowful silence; young as she was, she had
been too long his companion not to have gained
some powerful views of the great truths he had
ever been anxious to inculcate. She had also
been too long his companion not to comprehend
and feel for his disquietude. She threw her
arms round his neck, and promised to be guided
by his counsel in every action of her life; but
she besought him not to take blame to himself
for Clara's wilful conduct, or Julia's determination
to become Lady Ennismore. Her father
smiled, but did not combat her prayer. Christobelle
was too young to be made the confidante
of his feelings&mdash;much too young to distinguish
the cause of his self-reproach. He could not
tell <i>her</i> of one whom he deprecated as the
cause of Clara's misery; that he was mourning,
when too late, the power he had delegated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
into unsafe hands. He would not tell her his
indulgence to his wife had been treacherously
and even wickedly dealt with; that he had given
his affections to a worldly being, and that its
consequences were now gnawing at his heart.</p>

<p>True, he could turn with pleasure to Anna
Maria and Isabel, and behold <i>them</i> happy. They
had married men of principle&mdash;men whom he
approved and valued; but who would wipe away
the tears from Clara's eyes?&mdash;from Julia's once
smiling cheeks? Not the Protector, who swore
to cherish each young and inexperienced creature
at the altar. Not the world, which condemns
and punishes its erring and unhappy
members, with ruthless pertinacity. They must
turn to another and more merciful Judge for
pardon and peace; and had they been taught
to pray for help in time of need? A father
could not unfold all this to the youthful mind
of his child; though his melancholy tone and
countenance struck her attention, as he spoke
to her of earthly and heavenly things. She
could not <i>then</i> understand the chastening of his
mind, but she listened in deep attention to his
precepts; and fancied that nothing in this world
could have power to attract her from him who
loved and cherished her so dearly. To marry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and quit the study, its quiet, its books, its
happy associations! Oh! Lucy Kerrison might
wish to leave Ripley, and the family quarrels
which broke its rest; but Christobelle felt she
could never like a human being, as she honoured
and loved her father.</p>

<p>The Pynsents arrived in the highest spirits at
Wetheral, and the sight of Anna Maria gave
animation to her mother's countenance for a
season. She thought her very much improved
in looks, and it was not her fault that Anna
Maria had not rouged before she married; but
Sir John had many prejudices, and that was one
of them. Tom Pynsent was delighted.</p>

<p>"Well, I do like to hear every one say my
little wife is rouged; it proves how rosy she is
grown. All my care, Lady Wetheral, all my
care. I let her do as she liked; Biddulph, and
Jack Smith, and myself, went after her, and the
Count; every where kept her in sight, you know.
She talked herself into that pretty rosy face."</p>

<p>"You were not conspicuous, my love, I hope,"
said her mother, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; Tom liked me to chat my French,
did you not, my love?"</p>

<p>"I liked you to make yourself happy," answered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Tom, affectionately. "You made <i>me</i>
happy, by getting such a nice healthy bloom."</p>

<p>A look of affection, and a pressure of the
hand, attested his lady's gratitude and love,
though she coloured through her rouge at her
husband's remark.</p>

<p>"When we have lunched," continued Tom
Pynsent, taking nearly half a pigeon-pie into
his plate, "when we have just taken off the
edge of hunger, we'll have a ride on horseback,
Anny, and go over the old ground again. You
must have an old habit here, somewhere; let us
go and see our old love haunts."</p>

<p>Anna Maria was nothing loth; her matrimony
was of only four or five months' standing, and
they were lovers still. She was quite willing to
take an agreeable ride with her dear Tom.</p>

<p>"Let us have the young one, too," exclaimed
the good-natured Tom Pynsent; "habits and
horses for two, and you shall see the world,
missy."</p>

<p>"I shall want Bell," said Lady Wetheral,
annoyed at the idea of a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Mrs.
Pynsent.</p>

<p>"Ay, Miss Bell, stay with us, I shall want a
casting vote, and I shall want you to introduce
me to Sir John's study," cried Mrs. Pynsent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
giving Christobelle a thump upon her shoulder.
"I must become acquainted with you, young
lady."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral's possession of manner concealed
the disgust she endured at this movement.
She turned to her eldest daughter, and
inquired at what hour she would wish her horse
equipped.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor Lady Mary, let her be saddled
at three, if you please. I think three o'clock,
Tom, will do."</p>

<p>"Lord, Mrs. Tom, you will be as hot as fire,
riding in the blazing sun," exclaimed Mrs. Pynsent.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mrs. <i>Tom Pynsent</i> would prefer
her ride at four o'clock," observed Lady Wetheral.</p>

<p>"My daughter, Tom, will melt away," replied
Mrs. Pynsent, giving her a touch with the
elbow. "Suppose your pretty face melts, eh,
Mrs. Tom? That would be a pretty confession,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"At what hour, Mrs. Pynsent?" demanded
her mother, addressing Anna Maria, and taking
no notice of Mrs. Pynsent, the elder.</p>

<p>"Say four, then, at once," continued Mrs.
Pynsent, "and don't confound mother and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
daughter; I am Pen Pynsent, and that is my
daughter, Tom&mdash;Mrs. Tom, till I am underground,
and out of the way."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral bowed with much suavity and
politeness to her unrefined companion. "She
had great pleasure in acknowledging her daughter
Mrs. Tom Pynsent, the wife of an excellent and
honourable man, standing high in the county."</p>

<p>"To be sure&mdash;and very happy to get him.
Every girl can't marry such a tight lad as Tom;
as good a son as ever comforted a mother's eyes.
He's none of your pimmeny fellows, like I know
who; or a ranting, violent husband, like Foster
Kerrison. He's good, downright Tom; and Mrs.
Tom may look the best of them in the face."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent winked at his lady, and continued
paying his <i>devoirs</i> to the pigeon-pie.
Lady Wetheral could never argue with Mrs. Pynsent,
and a short silence ensued. Mrs. Pynsent's
forcible mode of expressing her ideas, and her
perfectly opposite views upon every subject,
prevented all hope of coalition with Lady Wetheral,
who could not endure abruptness, or
what the world denominated "a good, downright
person." Her education in high life did
not enable her to shape her sentiments and
actions to the tone of country society, so far removed
from the atmosphere of courtly phrases;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and of all her acquaintance, Mrs. Pynsent was
the least suited to her tastes. She disliked
"truth-telling," disagreeable people; she deprecated
people who "spoke their mind" upon
every point, and at all times; in short, Mrs.
Pynsent was never to be endured but as the mother
of Tom; and now he was secured, nothing
could be more intolerable than her presence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent took up her workbag after
luncheon, and sat down to knot. Lady Wetheral
politely stationed herself near her guest, and appeared
occupied with her worstedwork. Anna
Maria looked over Christobelle as she was busied
copying a drawing for her father; and Tom
Pynsent was gone to sit an hour with him in the
study, and talk of Paris, till the riding-horses
should make their appearance. Mrs. Tom Pynsent
complimented her sister upon her first
essays in landscape-painting, and prognosticated
she would be the only accomplished Miss Wetheral
of the family. Her mother smiled upon her.</p>

<p>"I may certainly confess you are the 'beautiful,'
my dear Anna Maria. I quite congratulate
you upon the addition of a little rouge."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I would never congratulate a daughter
upon her painted face," exclaimed Mrs. Pynsent;
"a woman with her cheeks raddled, is like
the poor things in the street."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Anna Maria blushed, but in perfect good
humour with her mother-in-law. She answered
the remark with a confession of its propriety,
and expressed her wish it should not be made
known to her husband that she <i>did</i> employ art
in improving her complexion.</p>

<p>"I was very foolish to rouge at all, because
Tom did not like the idea of it; but the Count
de Nolis pressed it so much as a material improvement
to a lady who was naturally pale, that
I tried a very little gradually; and poor dear
Tom had such pleasure in fancying I was becoming
blooming, that I never could bear to
disappoint him. I assure you it was only to
please Tom."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent was appeased at once by this
candid confession: any thing which bore a
meaning, or shew of affection towards her son,
won her instant assent. She was satisfied the
motive was good, and she upheld her daughter-in-law
from that hour in deceiving her husband.
But there was a reservation in her approval.</p>

<p>"It's a nasty trick, Mrs. Tom, and a bad
trick; but if you love your husband, and wish to
please his eye&mdash;God help me!&mdash;I have nothing
to say. Whoever loves Tom, has my heart and
good-will. But leave it off as soon as you can."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is very becoming," observed Lady Wetheral,
"and it is done in all the highly fashionable
circles."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's <i>done</i>, my Lady Wetheral, and so
are many abominable practices. Your high
ladies do gamble, and they do intrigue, my Lady
Wetheral; but you would not approve your
daughter's fashionable turn, I hope, in that
line."</p>

<p>Her ladyship disliked "home thrusts" also,
in her catalogue of country annoyances. She
made no reply to Mrs. Pynsent's remark, but
coolly inquired of Anna Maria when Miss Wycherly's
marriage was likely to take place.</p>

<p>"Oh! I am most likely to know my niece's
affairs," resumed Mrs. Pynsent; "my daughter,
Tom, can't explain Pen's intentions. Bill Wycherly
gives up Lidham to the young couple."</p>

<p>"A very excellent resolution," observed Lady
Wetheral, with emphasis.</p>

<p>"I don't think so, at all. Bill should keep
the staff in his own hand: I'm very angry with
him. Let the young wait for the old, is my
maxim."</p>

<p>"The old, perhaps, are more fitted for retirement,"
drily remarked Lady Wetheral.</p>

<p>"They are fitter to be called fools who renounce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
their birthright," retorted Mrs. Pynsent,
"and so I told Bobby when he offered Hatton
to Tom. My son knew better than to accept it.
Tom never forgets his duty, and his wife may
say her prayers for having caught him."</p>

<p>"I should feel inclined to soften that expression,"
observed Lady Wetheral, in her
gentlest accents; "the idea of catching a young
man is not a pleasing figure of speech."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent gave a short, loud laugh. "Why,
my Lady Wetheral, we won't stand upon words;
I express my knowledge of facts in few roundabout
phrases. I say what I think, and I can't
help the cap fitting too tight to be agreeable."</p>

<p>Anna Maria beheld the disgust of Lady Wetheral's
mind expressed upon her lowering brow.
A slight frown was the only public token of distaste
which was ever allowed to transpire: her
ladyship never rebutted, never argued. It was,
she averred, an indisputable sign of ill-breeding,
wretched taste, and bad temper. She frowned,
and her daughter knew its purport. It was impossible
to leave two such ill-assorted companions
together; the undisguised sentiments of
Mrs. Pynsent, uttered with masculine energy of
manner and voice, would overpower her conscious
yet refined companion&mdash;perhaps cause a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
nervous attack, and originate an illness. Mrs.
Tom Pynsent relinquished all intention of riding
with her husband. Her presence might check
her mother-in-law's vivacity; it would certainly
give pleasure to her mother, and it must be a
satisfaction to Christobelle. Mrs. Pynsent's
good nature even turned her daughter-in-law's
expressed intention to Christobelle's advantage.</p>

<p>"Very good move, Mrs. Tom&mdash;very good
move. You and myself are old women, as it
were; we will sit here chatting to my Lady Wetheral,
but let every one have their turn. Tom
will ride with poor Miss Bell, and amuse her:
the poor thing is cooped up to death here."</p>

<p>"My daughter Bell has every advantage. I
rather think my daughter considers her mother's
society sufficiently agreeable," said Lady Wetheral,
bending politely but haughtily to her
guest.</p>

<p>"Considers a fiddlestick, my Lady Wetheral!"
replied Mrs. Pynsent, knotting with great energy.
"What young girl considers herself agreeable
with no playfellows, and a hipped Lady-mother?
No, no; air, my lady&mdash;exercise, my lady&mdash;companions,
my lady: <i>that</i> is poor Miss Bell's proper
entertainment. Tom will ride with her,
poor thing."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Wetheral did not condescend to reply
to this sally. However lowly Christobelle stood
in her eyes, however petulant she might be to
the "stupid, awkward girl <i>herself</i>," "poor thing!"
sounded most offensively to her ear. Anna
Maria again interfered by ringing the bell, and
begging that Mr. Tom Pynsent might be summoned
from the library. Tom's presence, she
knew, was always desirable every where; but
his mother's attention would be riveted upon
her son, and Lady Wetheral would escape the
inevitable contention which followed her own
remarks. This was the first time the ladies had
ever been placed a whole morning in juxtaposition.
Anna Maria was sure the visit would
never take place again. Each party would decline
a second day of family intercourse.</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent's entrance with Sir John effected
a change in every one's situation. Christobelle
was to ride; Mrs. Pynsent decided upon that
measure, and her father enforced it. He was
then to do the honours of the conservatory and
gardens to his guest, while the mother and daughter
worked and conversed <i>tête-à-tête</i>. So far,
all was prudently arranged, and promised peace.</p>

<p>Christobelle was enchanted with her ride.
Tom Pynsent did not possess conversational
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
powers, but his want of talent was more than
balanced by invincible good-nature, and manly
courage of body and mind. Christobelle loved
him for his kind heart and anxious wish to make
every body happy; and she loved him for the
devotion he expressed for Anna Maria at all
times, and in all places. It was not an uxorious
affection, effeminate, and annoying to witness.
Tom Pynsent loved with his whole heart the
woman who possessed his name, and was to share
his fortunes. He loved her with a manly tenderness,
which displayed itself in a thousand
forms, and raised him in public estimation by its
amalgamation with his very existence. It connected
his wife with the stable and the kennel;
it connected her with all his amusements. She
was part and parcel of every thing in which he
was concerned. What a man had Julia thrown
from herself, ere he discovered Anna Maria's love
and sufferings!</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent shewed Christobelle, with infinite
satisfaction, the spots most consecrated to
memory, as the scenes of Anna Maria's confessions.
He seemed to linger with pleasure in
the lane where his wife first disclosed her long-concealed
misery, and where he had dismounted
to impress a thousand kisses upon her hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
His tone changed, as he recapitulated his astonishment
and delight.</p>

<p>"By Jove, when I think of all this, I could
never bear to ride here, if any thing happened to
my little wife; but I hope not&mdash;I hope she will
see me into my grave, and be comfortable with
you all. She would do very well without me,
but I couldn't exist without her. I should let
Kerrison have the kennel then, and take the
shoes off the hunters. By Jove, they might turn
out for life, then."</p>

<p>Christobelle listened to her brother's remarks
with great interest; she could not understand
the deep affection of his heart at that time,
but she was sensible to the compliment of being
the depository of his thoughts. She was delighted
with his notice and attention; and particularly
felt its pleasing influence, because her
mother undervalued and reproached her daily
and hourly at Wetheral. She was very sorry
when their ride was brought to a close, and she
again returned to her apartment to dress for
dinner.</p>

<p>Anna Maria joined her sister; her hair was
forced into immense curls, by her French attendant,
Félicé, and her ringlets were frizzed
into bows. Félicé followed her mistress in green
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
silk. Such a novelty was rare and alarming
in Shropshire; they had heard of the allied
sovereigns being at that moment in London,
but nothing approaching to a foreigner had yet
appeared at Shrewsbury. Félicé was a creature
to be stared at, and Anna Maria would become
most formidably fashionable when once the
knowledge of her arrival should transpire. Anna
Maria said, "she had brought her maid to friz
Christobelle's very English head of hair into
something like effect. She bade her look in the
glass, and smile at her hair, combed straight in
front, and just turned up at the back. It was
something that would horrify De Nolis in the
autumn. She must positively have it dressed
properly."</p>

<p>"See now, Félicé; Miss Wetheral's hair
must be dressed this way."</p>

<p>"<i>Comme-ça, madame</i>," repeated the smiling
pretty Félicé.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>comme-ça</i>: friz this dreadful crop into
curls, <i>boucles</i>, Félicé&mdash;<i>grand boucles</i>, like mine.
<i>Donnez mademoiselle un</i> very nice <i>tournure</i>,
and let her be <i>très bien mise</i>. You may laugh,
Bell, but I assure you a Parisian perfectly understands
what you mean, if you only use the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
words '<i>coiffure</i>,' '<i>parure</i>,' or '<i>tournure</i>;' they
fill up the rest of the sentence intuitively."</p>

<p>Christobelle submitted to the torture of the
comb and curling-irons with great satisfaction.
Whatever was fashionable in Paris, must be admired
and envied in England, and her mother
would be pleased to see her decorated by the
hand of approved good-taste.</p>

<p>The hair was not the "<i>ultima thule</i>" of Félicé's
care. A "<i>bustle</i>" was appended to Christobelle's
waist, and the folds of her muslin frock were
drawn over it with the nicest care; her dress
was dragged down to give a lengthened appearance
to the waist, and the band tightened till she
could hardly breathe. Mrs. Tom Pynsent and
her "<i>artiste</i>" were charmed with the result of
their exertions. Félicé spoke a long sentence,
which Christobelle translated to her sister, whose
knowledge of the language was not at all improved
by four months' residence in Paris. It
was a well-turned compliment upon the change
in the young lady's appearance. Anna Maria
regretted that their education had been so little
attended to by Lady Wetheral.</p>

<p>"Papa has taught you so many accomplishments,
Bell! You draw, and you speak French,
and quote delightfully, Charles Spottiswoode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
says. You have had many advantages over us.
The Count de Nolis said I was rapidly improving
in French, and he advised me to return to Paris
soon, to learn the accent; but I cannot speak
it half so fluently as you do. I wonder what
mamma will say to your head? I think it perfect."</p>

<p>Their appearance certainly made a sensation
in the drawing-room, for Lady Wetheral raised
her glass with a surprised and satisfied expression
of countenance, and examined Christobelle
very attentively. Mrs. Pynsent caught a glance
of her head, curled, frizzed, and bowed in all
directions; and she exclaimed, "Hollo, there!
why, Miss Bell, what's the matter now? they
have made a dancing-dog of you!"</p>

<p>"You have done a very kind action by your
sister, my dear Mrs. Tom Pynsent," said Lady
Wetheral, still gazing at Christobelle through
her glass; "you have quite christianized her
style and appearance."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Mrs. Pynsent, "poor
Miss Bell! Well, now they <i>have</i> done it.
Curly-headed christians for ever, Mrs. Tom!
Who are you going to baptize next?"</p>

<p>"But does not Bell become her baptism?"
asked Anna Maria, smiling.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is always a pretty girl; and, what is
far better, she is a good and kind-hearted girl;
but I don't like your French fashions."</p>

<p>"Pray, Bell, let your hair be attended to in
future," said Lady Wetheral, still holding her
glass to her eye. "I approve of your present
appearance. I cannot endure your thick, short
hair hanging over your eyes."</p>

<p>"By far the most natural, at her age," observed
Mrs. Pynsent; "a young girl dressed up
that figure, is very unnatural and ridiculous."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral did not reply. Tom Pynsent
was much amused at the transformation, when
he entered the room. He bantered Christobelle,
with great good-humour, upon the havoc she
would cause among the hearts of the schoolboys,
the very next vacation, if she persisted in twisting
her hair into sausages; and he pitied poor
Frank Kerrison, who would certainly renounce
murdering cockchafers, to write verses upon her
beauty. Sir John smiled, and stroked his daughter's
cheek, but he offered no comment upon her
person. The circumstance was almost too trifling
to amuse even the dull half hour before dinner.
A whim of Mrs. Tom Pynsent had led her to
dress her sister's hair; and its end was answered,
by causing a few smiles and a jest. The incident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
passed away, and was forgotten in the summons
to dinner; but that very trifling occurrence
laid the foundation of much future misery:&mdash;it
woke up Lady Wetheral's slumbering energies,
and led her to speculate upon the establishment
of a creature whom she had, till that moment,
renounced as awkward and vulgar&mdash;a girl belonging
exclusively to her father&mdash;whose futurity
was indifferent to herself. Causes, however
trifling in their origin, swell into fearful effects,
under the agency of the weak or wicked.</p>

<p>When the ladies returned into the drawing-room,
Anna Maria and Christobelle enjoyed a
short <i>tête-à-tête</i> during their mother's <i>siesta</i>.
Anna Maria said it would be impossible to hope
for pleasant intercourse between the houses of
Pynsent and Wetheral. The two ladies had
not agreed in one sentiment upon any subject
during Christobelle's absence, and each appeared
irritated and wearied. It was altogether abrupt
truth on one side, and haughty silence on the
part of her mother: she was very certain there
would be no pleasant result from this day's occurrences.
Her two relations had never before
passed a day together, dependent upon each
other's society; and it had only taught them
how impossible it would be to meet again upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
those terms. She would tell Tom her thoughts
as soon as they arrived at Hatton&mdash;Tom could
manage every thing&mdash;she did not believe any
body could resist Tom's pleasing way of arranging
things: perhaps Tom would entreat his
mother not to contradict Lady Wetheral so very
flatly.</p>

<p>This was distressing intelligence: if Lady
Wetheral felt disturbed by Mrs. Pynsent's peculiar
style of manners, there would be an end at
once to Christobelle's happy prospects; she was
becoming jealous of her daughter's society,
though she professed indifference; and she
could see little of her sister's company, if Mrs.
Pynsent was necessarily included in the invitation,
which welcomed the Tom Pynsents, at all
times, to the now dull halls of Wetheral Castle.
Lady Wetheral's offended taste was a mental
wound which never closed. She was not harsh
towards vice&mdash;it might redeem itself; but rudeness
of manner, or a vulgar phraseology, was beyond
the limits of pardon. In both particulars
did Mrs. Pynsent certainly transgress; and her
ladyship's remarks, after their departure, betokened
her disgust and aversion to the society
of her departed guest.</p>

<p>"I shall feel obliged, Bell, by your silence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
upon the events of this disgusting day. Let me
forget, if possible, that I have been, for eight
hours, the companion of stentorian coarseness
and vulgarity. I must regret seeing your sister
but seldom, as I apprehend I shall do. I cannot
be upon terms with a woman who designates her
son's lady 'Mrs. Tom:' now ring, if you please,
for my <i>sal volatile</i>."</p>

<p>The next day's post brought a letter from
Mrs. Boscawen: its contents were most cheering.
"She was very anxious Christobelle should know
how beautiful her darling babe was growing, and
that it had outgrown its first pinafores. Boscawen
was quite as fond of the darling as she
could possibly be herself, and Christobelle would
be amused by seeing him nurse it to sleep, while
she tamboured its little frock. Miss Tabitha
was gone to stay a few weeks at Worcester, with
Mrs. Ward, and there was no one now at Brierly
to alarm her with heat, and cold, with drinking
too little, or eating too much. She was perfectly
happy with her dear Boscawen, nursing
and laughing all day long&mdash;no books&mdash;no lectures.
Oh, if Chrystal could but see her <i>now</i>!"</p>

<p>A postscript, in Mr. Boscawen's hand-writing,
was equally valuable, and gave deep satisfaction
to Sir John Wetheral. These were his words:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have lived many years in seclusion, and in
the dull misery of a long bachelorship; but I am
repaid by a happiness, too fondly valued to describe.
The remainder of my life will pass in
making an innocent and exemplary wife and
mother, as happy as mortality will allow, and
poor human nature can enjoy.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">"Yours faithfully,</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 2em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<span class="smcap">C. Boscawen</span>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was grateful happiness to Sir John Wetheral,
to reflect upon the destiny of Isabel.
Boscawen's age was an unpromising opening
to the fortunes of a young creature attached
to juvenile pleasures, and averse to the
restraints of tuition: but Sir John judged that
the high principles of the man to whom he should
commit the welfare of his child, would be the
safeguard of her happiness. The atmosphere of
Wetheral was unfavourable to mental culture.
At Brierly, the society of her husband would
enrich Isabel's mind with stores from his own
deep resources; and her heart would become
refined and exalted by Boscawen's strict integrity
of thought and action. He had judged
rightly. Isabel loved Boscawen for his kindness
of heart; and the birth of her infant knit their
feelings together, in one dear object of continually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
increasing solicitude, which would not
dissolve again. Anna Maria was happy, also,
with her honest and affectionate Tom Pynsent;
but what was to be the hope of Clara?&mdash;clouds
and darkness rested upon it.</p>

<p>Christobelle was now to prepare for her visit
to Bedinfield. She wondered at the sudden intention,
on her father's part, to go uninvited to
Lord Ennismore; but she was not a party to the
events&mdash;if such there were&mdash;which gave rise to
the meditated visit. Christobelle's youth precluded
her from entering into the consultations,
or bearing a part in the correspondence, of her
father: she could only guess all was not right,
when he spoke of Bedinfield, because his smile
fled, and his expression became melancholy; but
she was an utter stranger to its cause. She was
perfectly content to know she was preparing to
visit Julia, and to travel with her father. Her
mother spoke very seriously to her the evening
before they quitted Wetheral.</p>

<p>"Bell, you will have Taylor to attend you at
Bedinfield. I admire Miss Willis's taste in your
dresses: she is unrivalled in her selections, and
your figure is considerably improved since Félicé
has given you a few general instructions. The
long waist is extremely becoming to you. Your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
hair gives quite a changed expression to your
whole person now, Bell."</p>

<p>"I am very glad, mamma, you approve of it."</p>

<p>"I do, very much: I have some hopes you
will equal your sisters in appearance. If you
persevere in attending to your hair, which is such
a graceful ornament to a woman, I shall have
some pride in your well-doing. I never looked
at you before, Bell, you were such a dowdy-looking
creature. Walk across the room&mdash;head
up, Bell: really, that dress is very becoming."</p>

<p>Christobelle walked several times up and down
the boudoir, to allow her mother to complete
her observations. She was to throw her head
gracefully back&mdash;she was to curtesy, as if in the
act of receiving company&mdash;she was bid to come
forward and offer a fan, with an air of easy composure.
She performed many disagreeable, but
extremely necessary evolutions, to give her mother
satisfaction; and, unfortunately, her dress,
and her eagerness to bring the lesson to an end,
assisted her success. She was decided a creature
not destitute of a certain air, and, as Landscape
Brown would word it, there was "great
capability," with severe pruning, and much persevering
determination, to shine. If Christobelle
made good use of the three following years, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
mother did not despair of matching her even
higher than Lady Ennismore. "A very Frenchy
style of dress and walk would prove a great novelty,
and attract gentlemen who always approved
the novelties they failed to admire. She
would cause a sensation, and some contention in
opinion, which would inevitably make her the
highest fashion in Shropshire."</p>

<p>This was an unlooked-for change in the politics
of Wetheral. Little did Christobelle think
Félicé's hand would have wrought such evil to
an unsuspecting, unspeculative creature as herself.
Little did she dream, under her tasteful
assistance, to spring, at a bound, from the "awkward,
dull Bell&mdash;Sir John's tiresome, learned
daughter," into an object of speculation, which
would again waken her mother's powers into
action, to draw her from happy tranquillity, into
scenes of distracting contention. She was glad
to think the Bedinfield visit stood between her
and a second lesson upon graceful movements.
She could not dive into the future, or draw conclusions
from the present, at this moment: she
rejoiced only to escape lectures upon style, and
reprimands for acting upon impulse. Christobelle
hoped to find freedom and happy enjoyment
at Bedinfield, and that pleasing thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
gave her spirits to endure her mother's unceasing
efforts to arouse "a proper vanity" in her
mind, and make her look forward to a ducal, or,
at least, the coronet of a marquis.</p>

<p>"Bell, you shall certainly be emancipated
from the seclusion of Wetheral, and receive the
first advantages which a dancing-master can give.
I will endeavour to persuade your poor father to
give us a spring or two in London, or a trip to
Paris. Paris I should approve most. Félicé has
quite delighted me with her tasteful fancy."</p>

<p>"I prefer Wetheral, mamma, and my pleasant
readings with papa in the library, if you please."</p>

<p>"Young ladies are not the soundest judges upon
their own case," replied her mother, drily; "they
may prefer indolence to activity: and, for a season,
they may be blind to their own defects; but
they will take care, in the end, to throw the consequences
of their folly upon their parents, as
Clara did. She forgot her own very insupportable
violence of temper; and her endeavour to
blame me as the cause of her high position, as
Lady Kerrison, was improper. <i>I</i> find my daughters
establishments, but I look to <i>them</i> to fill
that situation with propriety."</p>

<p>"Sir Foster is very violent to all his people,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
mamma" Christobelle observed, hoping to shield
Clara from remark.</p>

<p>"Your sister knew that, Bell: every body
knew Sir Foster was a dull brute. She should
never have entered into collision with him. If
he kicked his servants, he was not likely to
strike his wife without provocation. Clara is
extremely provoking."</p>

<p>It was true, indeed. Lady Kerrison did act
most unadvisedly in rousing a turbulent nature,
when it was actually at rest: but who pointed
her attention to the match, and softened down
every report which bruited Sir Foster's violence
to the neighbourhood? Surely, Lucy Kerrison's
remarks upon her father's temper was a beacon
to parents, to avoid the domestic quicksands of
Ripley&mdash;yet Christobelle was present, and heard
her mother vindicate Sir Foster's treatment of
the fishmonger, and urge the eligibility of the
connection. Lady Wetheral continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am not at all pleased with the junior Pynsents
being guests in the country&mdash;Mrs. Pynsent
will follow them every where, and quote 'Mrs.
Tom' to her friends. I cannot say that match
has been productive of pleasure to me. Lady
Ennismore, the dowager, has been offensive in
her conduct, by presuming to close her son's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
house to his friends. Bedinfield is no pleasant
refuge for <i>me</i>, I can see. I can never witness
Clara's quarrels&mdash;and Brierly is so secluded, besides
Isabel having the child always with her, that
I have no satisfaction in <i>that</i> quarter. What
comfort have I in my girls' marriages? You must
make up to me for these sad disappointments,
Bell. You shall marry Lord Selgrave, when you
are both introduced into life."</p>

<p>"Lord Selgrave, mamma! I never saw him
in my life."</p>

<p>"So much the better: the introduction rests
with me. Lord Farnborough will not leave
Shropshire, and Selgrave, the boy, will be amongst
us. Farnborough Stacey will be the favourite
residence, even when he becomes Duke of Forfar.
You shall be Lady Selgrave, Bell, the future
Duchess of Forfar: does not that title raise your
little vanity, and produce ambitious wishes?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, mamma, I would rather be comfortable
in the library, reading to papa."</p>

<p>"If there is any thing I detest," exclaimed
Lady Wetheral, with great asperity, "it is a
slothful and mean mind, content to grovel in
lowliness&mdash;untouched by ambition&mdash;crouching
in dullness, and blind to prosperity. Leave my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
presence, Bell. Go to your chamber, and let
me see you no more."</p>

<p>Christobelle prepared to obey the harsh injunction.
She lighted her taper, and turned to
utter "good-night." Her mother waved her
hand.</p>

<p>"Say nothing. I do not choose to be disturbed
to-morrow by your appearance. I have
no regard for blind obstinacy&mdash;pass on in silence,
if you please."</p>

<p>Christobelle quitted the boudoir in tears. Why
was her early life to be embittered with reproaches
concerning those things which might never take
place? and why was her mind to be tortured into
projects which could not affect her heart, or her
time of life? She rushed to her father's study,
and threw herself into his arms, weeping. He
was surprised at the movement, and still more
so at her words:&mdash;"Oh, papa, don't let me be
obliged to marry. Don't make me think of Lord
Selgrave; for I never saw him, and I cannot
marry him."</p>

<p>"My dear Chrystal," he exclaimed, in astonishment,
"I cannot understand you."</p>

<p>Christobelle explained to him her mother's
wishes, and her anger at her disclaiming matrimony
with Lord Selgrave. He smiled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is sad folly, my dear child; I ought not
to allow myself to feel entertained at your alarm,
for I see the pernicious effects of education extending
to yourself: but do not weep, Chrystal.
No one shall take you from me, without your
consent."</p>

<p>"I may always live with you, papa, and stay
at Wetheral?" she asked, as the tears coursed
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"You shall never quit me till you say, 'Papa,
I wish to leave you for the home of another.'"</p>

<p>"And that will never, never be, my own dear
papa!" Christobelle embraced him with joyous
gratitude, and smiled through her tears.</p>

<p>"Then be happy, my child, and think no more
of little Lord Selgrave. You, at least, shall not
reproach me hereafter with weakness of character.
Go and sleep sweetly, and prepare for to-morrow's
journey."</p>

<p>Christobelle received her father's blessing, and
her heart was no longer sorrowful. He would
watch over and protect her! She would not be
driven to marry Lord Selgrave, and renounce her
peaceful station by his side. She could live with
him, and read to him for ever! She became calm,
and her mother's angry glances faded from her
recollection. Christobelle retired to her slumbers
in peace, that night.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>


<p>Bedinfield appeared a kingly residence. The
mansion stood before the traveller's gaze, with
its towers and battlements, grand and imposing
to the view. Had Lady Wetheral accompanied
her husband, she would have decided that happiness
must reign uncontrolled in that most
stately dwelling. There was grandeur and repose
in the scene, as they advanced to the massive
pile of building; and there was stately
ceremony enforced, when they arrived at its
portals.</p>

<p>It was seven by the chapel clock, when Sir
John Wetheral and his daughter entered the hall
of Bedinfield, and a train of footmen in gorgeous
livery bandied their names, till they were ushered
into a vast apartment, richly carved in oak. It
was untenanted: there was a vase of rare exotics
upon a small silver table, which some hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
had apparently quitted in haste, for some of the
flowers had fallen upon the Persian carpet, and
their stalks were wet and freshly gathered.
Christobelle's young ideas had considered Wetheral
Castle the criterion of elegance, and her
eager curiosity examined with surprise the magnificent
decoration around. The superb silver
tables&mdash;the costly cabinets&mdash;the whole style of
grand simplicity delighted her taste, and astonished
her mind. She turned to her father with
feelings of ecstasy.</p>

<p>"Can there be any thing more grand than
this, papa? Can any place be more superbly
beautiful? Oh, look at that lovely cabinet&mdash;that
row of cabinets&mdash;and those paintings!
How happy Julia must be!"</p>

<p>"Does all this create happiness, Chrystal?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, that was a wrong word&mdash;but how
<i>pleased</i> Julia must be, looking at these things,
and thinking they are her own! But why does
not Julia come to us, papa? Did not she expect
us to-day?"</p>

<p>Sir John paused, as he was accompanying
Christobelle in her passage up the apartment,
and he addressed her with seriousness.</p>

<p>"Chrystal, make no observations of any kind,
and ask no questions of me, or of Julia. I expect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
great prudence from you. You are now
my companion and friend, and you must learn
to veil much surprise, by silence. Be very prudent,
my child, and remark nothing to your
sister."</p>

<p>"I will be very prudent, papa," answered
Christobelle, in a whisper. The vastness of the
room, and the mystery expressed in her father's
words, struck her with awe. She already felt
as though silence must reign with so much grandeur,
and that liberty of speech dwelt not in
lofty apartments. She continued silently examining
a portrait of extreme beauty, which she
was aware represented the Dowager Lady Ennismore,
in her youth. It still retained a considerable
degree of likeness&mdash;the eye could never
change&mdash;its extraordinary expression was there&mdash;and
the haughty look, subdued by the collision
of high society, was admirably expressed in
the painting. Christobelle was irresistibly attracted
by the portrait, and she gazed upon it
till a door opened near her, and roused her attention.
A female attendant approached. She
was a tall, stately person, attired with peculiar
neatness and precision. She brought Lady Ennismore's
compliments of welcome. Her ladyship
invited her guests to retire to their apartments.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
She would have the pleasure of meeting
them in the drawing-room when the great bell
pealed, and after her guests had refreshed themselves
by changing their attire.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral advanced, slightly bowing
to the stately messenger.</p>

<p>"I believe I address an attendant of Lady
Ennismore?"</p>

<p>"I have the honour to attend the Dowager
Countess of Ennismore," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Your message is from Lady Ennismore,
my daughter, is it not?" observed Sir John,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"My message is from the Dowager Countess,"
replied her attendant.</p>

<p>"Lady Ennismore is probably from home?"</p>

<p>"The young Lady Ennismore is in her dressing-room,"
was the answer. "I am deputed to attend
Miss Wetheral to her apartment."</p>

<p>This was extraordinary. Was not Bedinfield
the property of Julia and her lord? Yet the
message of compliment was tendered by the
Countess Dowager, as if she still presided over
the mind and estate of her son. There was something
gravely suspicious in this coldly polite reception,
which disturbed the father's heart. Christobelle
begged to know if her room was situated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
near her father's bedchamber, and she turned to
him with a look of earnest alarm. He smiled.</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral feels a little nervous among
strangers; may I inquire if the rooms destined
for us are near each other?"</p>

<p>"They are near," was the laconic reply, and
Christobelle prepared to depart. A servant entering
at the moment, to offer his services to Sir
John, they proceeded together to the great gallery,
into which their apartments opened. The stately
female pointed to a heavily-carved oak-door, as
she preceded Christobelle. "Sir John Wetheral
sleeps in the crimson chamber." She then threw
open the door of a large gloomy room appropriated
to Christobelle. "Yours, Miss Wetheral,
is the tapestried chamber." She then
curtseyed and withdrew.</p>

<p>Taylor was in a dressing-room adjoining, laying
out her young lady's wardrobe, and Christobelle
surveyed the horrors of the tapestried
chamber, which she was sure would in itself
disturb her slumbers. The "Murder of the Innocents"
stood in enormous proportions at the
bottom of the room facing her bed, which was
decorated with sable plumes round its summit.
The brawny arms of the soldiery seizing the
young children, their dreadful eyes, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
weapons they brandished over the heads of the
hapless babes, took effect upon her imagination,
and terrified her. Christobelle was quite sure
the glare of the high wax-lights, when she retired
for the night, would raise them into living
bodies, that would "live, and move, and have
their being," to her extremity of terror. The
deep recesses, the dark oak furniture&mdash;all and
each combined to render the room terrible. She
would have given worlds to be at that moment
even in the boudoir at Wetheral.</p>

<p>Sir John tapped at his daughter's door, as he
prepared to descend to the drawing-room: Christobelle
was dressed, and ready to accompany
him. She begged him to see her safely to her
room-door every night, and confessed her alarm
at the idea of passing so many hours in a place
so full of horrors. If he could only see the
horrid objects which glared round the walls of
her room, he would not wonder at her disquietude!</p>

<p>Sir John endeavoured to reason Christobelle
into calmness, and he inquired why her rest
should be disturbed by pictorial representations
of Scripture history. Was not the hand of her
Maker as mercifully stretched forth to uphold
her among gobelin tapestry, as in the paper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
hangings of Wetheral? Christobelle acknowledged
it was so. She was silenced; she did
not offer any defence for her alarms, but she
could not suppress them. That chamber would
never be her "sleeping" apartment. She should
never be able to close her eyes.</p>

<p>A servant was in waiting to announce them,
as they descended into the hall. The folding-doors
were thrown open, their names were called
over with proper emphasis, and they found
themselves in the presence of Lord and Lady
Ennismore, and the Countess-dowager. The
latter rose, and advanced with her usual suavity.
She took both Sir John's hands in hers.</p>

<p>"My dear Sir John, this is a real and unexpected
honour. I am delighted to see you.
Miss Wetheral, you are welcome: Julia is
anxious, I see, to appropriate you&mdash;fly to her,
my love. We are a small family-party, you
see, Sir John Wetheral; but we shall endeavour
to amuse you at Bedinfield. Lady Wetheral
is well, I hope."</p>

<p>Sir John replied in courteous terms, that his
lady was in health.</p>

<p>"I hope you will find our dear Julia well,
and as handsome as ever. Our Staffordshire air
is excellent, and Julia's bloom is, I think, increased.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Julia, I must not monopolise your
father. It would not be just, so I resign him
with reluctance."</p>

<p>The Dowager led Sir John towards the young
Lady Ennismore, who received him with almost
wild fondness. Lord Ennismore also came
forward.</p>

<p>"I have much pleasure in bidding you welcome,
Sir John Wetheral, as also yourself, Miss
Wetheral. I hope I see you both in good
health."</p>

<p>Lord Ennismore bowed low, and resumed his
seat. The Dowager Lady Ennismore spoke for
her son.</p>

<p>"My dear Ennismore feels with me the
honour and pleasure of this unexpected visit.
I have much to show Sir John, now that he has
favoured us with his company. I shall do the
honours of the Park to him, with great pleasure,
and request his opinion upon our new lodge."</p>

<p>"You will doubtless, my dear mother, show
our guest, Sir John, the new line of road through
the plantations."</p>

<p>"My dear Ennismore, our very first drive
will be through the plantations. I am proud
to exhibit your taste; it will always hold its
place in my mind, as our lion of Bedinfield."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was not my suggestion, my dear mother,"
replied the poor, dull-looking Lord Ennismore.</p>

<p>"My dear son, you approved of my idea,
which makes it your own affair. The new drive
is certainly an affair of your own carrying out.
I had little to do with it. The architect, you
know, is secondary. The filling up requires
knowledge and taste: that was your part, dear
Augustus."</p>

<p>A smile of satisfaction stole over the pallid
face of Lord Ennismore, but it could not light up
the leaden expression of his eyes, as they rested
upon his mother's face.</p>

<p>"I am glad you think highly of that road,
my dear mother."</p>

<p>"I think it the finest work upon the estate,
my dear son. I was trying to inoculate Julia
with my enthusiastic delight, yesterday."</p>

<p>"Julia does not admire it as you do," observed
Lord Ennismore, rising from the chair
near his lady, and taking a seat by his mother.</p>

<p>"We are not all granted the same tastes,"
replied her ladyship. "Bedinfield has been my
home many years, and you, my dear Augustus,
were born here. It must be a cherished place
to my heart."</p>

<p>"I hope it will be always your home."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Ennismore took his mother's hand, and
held it in his, till dinner was announced.</p>

<p>Julia did not hear the conversation which
took place between Lord Ennismore and her
mother-in-law, neither did she observe her lord's
change of situation: she was learning the news
of Wetheral from her father's lips, and her
whole attention was fixed upon him, and the
communications which deeply touched her heart.
Christobelle heard her complain of the silence
of all her friends: she dwelt with energy upon
the silence of Miss Wycherly, and mourned to
think how slightly her friendship had stood the
trial of a few months' absence. She had invited
Penelope to visit Bedinfield, but even politeness
had not elicited an answer from Lidham. She
felt very keenly the conduct of her early friends,
but Lady Ennismore had warned her seriously
that such would be the case, and her kindness
was Julia's greatest consolation.</p>

<p>"Have you not <i>once</i> heard from Penelope?"
asked her father, speaking low.</p>

<p>"I have never received a letter from Shropshire
since I married, papa." Julia's eyes filled
with tears at the thought of estranged affections.</p>

<p>"Penelope charged me with many messages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Julia. She desired me to say that, absent or
silent, her heart was unchanged, and Lidham
was your home, equally with Bedinfield and
Wetheral."</p>

<p>"Dear Penelope!" exclaimed Julia, with
clasped hands, "I was loth to think she loved
me less; but her happy lot should not make her
silent to her old friend!"</p>

<p>Julia's movement attracted the attention of
the Dowager. She addressed herself again to
Sir John.</p>

<p>"My dear Sir John, what do you think of
Staffordshire scenery? We do not relinquish
the palm of beauty to any county in the southern
part of Great Britain. Tell me exactly your
route."</p>

<p>Sir John gave a concise statement of their
little journey, which was commented upon by
her ladyship with vivacity. She entered into
descriptions of Staffordshire scenery, and the
Staffordshire aristocracy, with increasing energy,
keeping all attention engaged towards herself,
and allowing no respite for recommencing a conversation
with Julia. Lady Ennismore chatted
even through the immense hall, and to the very
dinner-table. Christobelle also watched the
elder Lady Ennismore with uncontrollable surprise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
take her seat at the head of the table,
while Julia quietly placed herself at her father's
side. Christobelle looked at her father, to observe
his movements; she did not meet his eye;
his expression of countenance and manner was
very grave, but he gave no evidence of having
noticed the circumstance: he was conversing
with Julia upon the arrival of the Tom Pynsents.</p>

<p>The dinner passed in solemn grandeur. The
party was too limited for general conversation,
and the presence of many servants checked all
approach to remarks beyond commonplace allusion
to the weather and climate of Staffordshire.
Christobelle admired the simplicity of the
apartment, in its magnificent proportions and
grand style of architecture, but she was glad
when the meal concluded, and the servants were
withdrawn.</p>

<p>The Dowager Lady Ennismore was then seen
to great advantage: Christobelle could not help
admiring the perfection of manners which rendered
her so fascinating to every one with whom
she came in contact. In spite of Julia's position,
so decidedly a position of disadvantage to
herself, and improper, as the wife of Lord Ennismore&mdash;in
the very face of that impropriety,
in spite of dislike to Lady Ennismore, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
cause of Julia's present situation, Christobelle
beheld her with a powerful admiration. She
was attracted by that refined attention, that
power of pleasing, so delicate, so full of tact,
accompanied by great personal beauty, which
takes the senses captive, even while we struggle
against its power. She admired the witchery
of her eyes, as she glanced upon each person
those captivating and flattering meanings, which
few minds could resist: and she was, beyond
expression, charmed by the attentions which
were offered to her youthful age, which fell like
oil upon the waters. The Dowager was long
past her <i>première jeunesse</i>; yet the vivacity of
her conversation, and the propriety of her style
of dress, threw over her whole person an air of
indescribable attraction. Sir John appeared to
watch her ladyship with deep attention; no
wonder, then, that Christobelle's unsuspicious
age drank largely of her fascination, that she
could never imagine the deep wickedness of her
nature, or believe such winning manners concealed
an imperious and dangerous spirit. Her
whole attention was fixed exclusively upon the
Dowager Lady Ennismore.</p>

<p>All moved together into the drawing-room.
The Countess laughingly apologised for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
abstemious habits of Bedinfield, and expressed
her gratification that her dear son never loved
the pleasures of the table&mdash;pleasures altogether
so gross, so unintellectual, that she wondered
gentlemen could lend themselves to an enervating
and disgusting consumer of existence.</p>

<p>"We are very sober people, Sir John, and
our little family-trio never separate after dinner.
I consider you in that affectionate light also,
therefore we will not lose each other's society
during your stay. I must have you form a little
ring round me, that I may enjoy the conversation
of each. My dear Miss Wetheral, you
must remain near me; I do not forget my young
friend. My dearest Julia, you will take your
little <i>siesta</i> as usual."</p>

<p>Julia declined a <i>siesta</i>; she expressed her indisposition
to sleep; she wished to listen to her
father, and ask for Shropshire news. She could
not sleep while her father and sister remained at
Bedinfield.</p>

<p>"My dearest Julia, I shall be seriously uneasy.
My dear son, let us prevail upon Julia not to
forego her <i>siesta</i>, so very strongly recommended
by Dr. Anstruther, so very necessary to her
health at this time!"</p>

<p>"My dear mother, you are always right; I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
agree with you, and think Lady Ennismore should
not omit her <i>siesta</i>," observed his lordship, looking
particularly dull.</p>

<p>"I do not feel its necessity now at all, dear
mother," observed Julia, affectionately pressing
Lady Ennismore's hand, and looking beseechingly
in her face. "My dear father and Chrystal take
away all inclination to sleep."</p>

<p>"I will not lose my daughter for all the world
can offer," exclaimed the Dowager, throwing her
arms round Julia. "My dear Julia, will you
not oblige me?"</p>

<p>"But, dearest Lady Ennismore, this <i>one</i> evening,
just to talk of Wetheral!"</p>

<p>"My love, I trust your father is intending
to honour us some days. Ennismore and myself
are uneasy. You will not give us disquietude,
Julia? Sir John will not advocate an abrupt
change of system, I feel assured. Oblige us, my
dearest Julia."</p>

<p>Julia arose to give pleasure; when did she
ever resist solicitation! She gave her father an
affectionate salute: "Dear papa, I shall not be
long away from you. Lady Ennismore is so
fearful of my health, that a <i>siesta</i> is considered
indispensable. Perhaps Chrystal will lull me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
sleep by tales of Wetheral. Come with me,
Chrystal."</p>

<p>The Countess caught Christobelle's hand as she
rose to accompany Julia.</p>

<p>"My dear young friend, I fear I must appear
a monster, but I am apprehensive; my Julia
must repose, not converse with dear and near
relations. It is too exciting for her. My dear
Julia never gives disquietude&mdash;she is aware of
my alarms. Oblige me and Ennismore, dear
Julia."</p>

<p>Julia retired with unwilling steps. Lord Ennismore
gave his arm to his lady, and escorted
her to the door of her dressing-room; he then
returned to his mother's side. She watched him
for some moments with an anxious expression;
and, while Sir John examined some exquisite
paintings, Christobelle heard the following dialogue
between Lady Ennismore and her son; it
took place in a low tone of voice, as if it was not
intended to reach other ears.</p>

<p>"My dear Augustus, have you taken your
dinner pill?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and the powder half an hour previous
to the pill."</p>

<p>"I hope and believe Julia reminded you of
it; I am glad she was so thoughtful, dear girl."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, my dear mother, it was your hint;
don't you remember saying this afternoon something
about dinner pills? It put me in mind of
taking one."</p>

<p>"Was it my hint, my dear son? Mothers
are foolishly attentive creatures, Augustus; they
are always so apprehensive. I often fear I am
wearisome!"</p>

<p>"You never can be wearisome in attending to
my pills, my dear mother. I should be very unwell
without them."</p>

<p>"My darling Julia forgets, Augustus; it is
not, I am sure, intentional."</p>

<p>"But <i>you</i> never forget. Julia did not pour
out my soda-water this morning. I was quite
ill for half an hour."</p>

<p>"Young wives are thoughtless creatures, Augustus.
A mother, you know, has an old, reflecting
head upon her shoulders."</p>

<p>"I am very glad you did not leave us, my
dear mother; Julia would have poisoned me by
this time."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, my dear son, not <i>quite</i> so bad as that;
some few mistakes, perhaps, but not so fearful a
catastrophe. I could wish you to call upon the
Delancy's to-morrow, Augustus; the General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
very much wished to ask your opinion upon some
political point."</p>

<p>"Certainly I will call at Huish, if you wish
it."</p>

<p>"Julia will ride with you: the world should
see you always together. It is politic, at any
rate. I will&mdash;&mdash;" Lady Ennismore's voice
sunk into a whisper. Again Christobelle caught
her words.</p>

<p>"It won't be a long affair. Make a round of
calls, and that will fill up time, you know." Another
long whisper. "My dear Sir John, you
are pleased with that Spagnoletti; it is a picture
of great merit. The late Lord Ennismore
was a great collector."</p>

<p>Her ladyship spoke now of pictures: she gave
the history of each painting, and detailed the
research of her late lord, who travelled through
Europe in order to form the splendid collection
at Bedinfield. When Lady Ennismore ceased
speaking, it was time for coffee, and Julia's reappearance
was anxiously expected by her sister.
With the same punctilious attention, Lord Ennismore
again left the apartment, and returned
with his lady under his arm. He placed her
near the Countess, made his bow, and offered to
sweeten her cup of coffee, with a cold formality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and an unexpressive smile. Julia looked pleased
by the unmeaning attention.</p>

<p>"Have you slept, dearest Julia?" asked the
Countess, as she sipped her coffee.</p>

<p>"No, indeed; I thought of Wetheral, and I
could not close my eyes. I wish I had been allowed
to remain here, dearest mother."</p>

<p>"Naughty girl!" Her ladyship tapped Julia's
arm lightly. "How can you trifle with my
anxiety? Sir John, how is our dear Julia looking?"</p>

<p>"She looks in excellent health. Julia always
enjoyed good health," said her father; "she
was the blooming rose at Wetheral."</p>

<p>"We watch over her with infinite anxiety,"
returned the Countess. "What should we do,
my dear lord, without Julia?"</p>

<p>Lord Ennismore cast a heavy glance upon
Julia, and smiled. "Dr. Anstruther is considered
clever; I trust no unfortunate accident
will occur at Bedinfield. You, my dear mother,
are extremely quick-sighted, and will avert
much that is unpleasant."</p>

<p>"You flatter me, my dear lord; but my fears
create watchfulness, and often, I fear, give disturbance
to my sweet Julia. Sir John, we are
a whist party; may I challenge you to play? I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
shall give my young friend the range of our
library as her amusement. I remember Miss
Wetheral's taste for reading. My poor memory
does yet retain the remembrance of my friends'
tastes. My dear lord will be so honoured in
the task of introducing you to his library. Allow
me to light a taper."</p>

<p>The Countess rose with graceful ease and
lightness of step to effect her purpose. Lord
Ennismore rose also, and bowed to Christobelle.
He spoke <i>so</i> heavily, and with such dull precision.</p>

<p>"I shall have pleasure in doing the honours
of the Bedinfield library to Miss Wetheral. I
cannot flatter myself it surpasses the very handsome
collection at Wetheral Castle, nevertheless,
it claims distinction. Do me the honour, Miss
Wetheral, to accept my arm."</p>

<p>Christobelle placed her arm within the awkwardly-extended
elbow which Lord Ennismore
held out for acceptance, and they proceeded to
the library. His lordship stood in the centre of
the room, and harangued with the tone and manner
of a showman who describes by rote what
his mind cannot understand.</p>

<p>"You see here, my agreeable Miss Wetheral,
a collection of the best authors. To the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
you will perceive the most approved ancients;
to the left, the most approved moderns. Before
us you will observe a splendidly-bound collection
of the works of our novelists, such as Fielding,
&amp;c.; and, behind us, there is an equally select
collection of plays, from our great Shakespeare
to almost the present hour."</p>

<p>"This is a magnificent library, Lord Ennismore, indeed."</p>

<p>"It is considered so, Miss Wetheral. Bedinfield has
long held pre-eminence in Staffordshire;
perhaps I am not wrong in asserting its superiority
to many mansions in the neighbouring
counties."</p>

<p>"I will, my lord, if you please, borrow Shakespeare
while you are at cards. I promise to replace
the book."</p>

<p>"We have a librarian, who replaces the different
works, and attends to the thing, Miss Wetheral;
do not give yourself the trouble. My
mother arranges every thing with perfect order."</p>

<p>"Not Julia, then?" she exclaimed in astonishment,
and without reflection. "Does not my
sister Julia arrange every thing at Bedinfield?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Wetheral; the Countess-dowager
has the management of my affairs. I should be
extremely sorry to remove the control of every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
thing into other hands. The Countess-dowager
conducts the establishment at Bedinfield."</p>

<p>"I thought the Countess was on a visit! I
really thought Julia and yourself lived at Bedinfield."
Christobelle looked with extreme surprise
at Lord Ennismore.</p>

<p>"The Countess-dowager remains with us," returned
his lordship. "We were anxious to
retain my dear mother at Bedinfield. She is
kind enough to transact all affairs for me. I am
not fond of business; and the Countess-dowager
thinks I am unequal in my health to severe attention
upon any subject. I am very fortunate
in possessing a relation who considers it almost
an amusement to overlook the concerns of Bedinfield."</p>

<p>"Julia was always extremely clever," exclaimed
Christobelle, anxious to do justice to
her talents. "Julia was always considered extremely
clever at Wetheral."</p>

<p>"No one can equal my mother in cleverness,
Miss Wetheral: every thing is in excellent order,
and I am always supplied with money when I
require it. The Countess-dowager attends even
to my private accounts: I have no trouble."</p>

<p>"But <i>Julia</i> attends to her own expenses,
Lord Ennismore?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Countess-dowager is kind enough to
attend to every thing, Miss Wetheral."</p>

<p>The library-door opened, and the "Countess-dowager"
appeared, leaning upon Julia's arm.
She bantered Christobelle and her son upon their
long absence.</p>

<p>"You are as partial to reading the titles of
books as Dr. Johnson, if that has been your occupation.
My lord has been very anxious to do
the honours properly, Miss Wetheral."</p>

<p>"We were not altogether talking of books,"
replied his lordship, mechanically offering his
arm to Julia.</p>

<p>"What could interest you so much, Miss
Wetheral? If books were not your subject, let
us also enjoy your remarks." The Countess
fixed her eyes upon Christobelle with a searching
expression. Christobelle coloured, but remained
silent.</p>

<p>"My dear mother, we were talking of you,"
said Lord Ennismore, taking her hand.</p>

<p>"Of <i>me</i>, Augustus? I cannot think I can form
a subject for Miss Wetheral's contemplation.
Pray let us return into the drawing-room."
This was spoken in a tone of slight displeasure.</p>

<p>"I never think any one can speak of you, my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
dear mother, without pleasure. I like to talk
of you."</p>

<p>"I am sure, dearest mother, you are the subject
of conversation to thousands," cried Julia,
with tenderness, laying her hand upon her ladyship's
arm.</p>

<p>"My dear children, you are very flattering in
your affection." Lady Ennismore's countenance
resumed its bland expression. "I must feel
happy in the love of two beings so dear to me.
May we always continue united, my beloved
children! Miss Wetheral, you are surprised at
this little scene."</p>

<p>The group returned into the drawing-room.
Lady Ennismore arranged the whist party, as
she arranged every thing connected with Bedinfield,
and Christobelle sat near the table, reading
her favourite Shakespeare. The whist party
broke up to partake of a slight refreshment, and
it was then time to separate for the night.
Christobelle did hope Julia would have accompanied
her to the tapestried chamber, but she
retired with Lady Ennismore, after "good
nights" were mutually expressed. Christobelle
was escorted to her room by her father in silence.
She wished much to speak to him, and inform
him of her short colloquy with Lord Ennismore;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
she therefore begged him to stay with her a few
minutes.</p>

<p>"Come into my room, Chrystal; I have no
lady's maid to overhear my words."</p>

<p>Christobelle crossed the broad gallery, and entered
the crimson chamber. It was hung with
dark crimson satin, as gloomy but not so appalling
as the tapestried apartment. She then told her
father the substance of her conversation in the
library, and also remarked upon Lady Ennismore's
look of displeasure. He listened gravely
to the disclosure, and observed, "Yes, I fancied
so&mdash;I can see it all."</p>

<p>"What do you see, papa?"</p>

<p>"You would not comprehend my views if I
expressed them, my love; your life is young,
and at present my remarks would be mysteries
to your innocent mind. The world will gradually
enlighten you to evil, when your part is to be
played upon its stage: till then, remain untainted
and happy. But when you enter upon
its cares, bear in mind the necessity of holding
fast integrity. It secures happiness here and hereafter.
And now, good night, my dear Chrystal."</p>

<p>Christobelle returned to her room, and beheld
the large eyes of a giant-centurion fixed
upon her. She could not struggle against alarm;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and Taylor sat by her till she fell asleep. She
endeavoured to amuse her young mistress by a
description of the scenes which were taking place
in the lower department of Bedinfield.</p>

<p>"Lord help us, Miss Wetheral, if you could
but see the pride of the two butlers, Mr. Spice
and Mr. Hornby! Miss, they won't look at, or
speak to, the other servants; and the great
housekeeper, with her two helpers, sit in a room
by themselves. Mr. Spice only stands by the
sideboard, and Mr. Hornby behind my lady the
Countess, just to look at. And do you know,
miss&mdash;poor Miss Julia that was&mdash;is considered
nobody at all. Every thing is my Lady Countess."</p>

<p>"Do they think so, Taylor?"</p>

<p>"I hear the servants that I associate with,
miss, make strange observations, as we do sometimes
talk over things amongst ourselves; and
they say that the Lady Countess is a very determined
woman, and manages my lord completely.
Poor Miss Julia has no power at all;
but the Lady Countess is very kind-spoken to
her, and they say Miss Julia is very content to
be put on one side."</p>

<p>"Lady Ennismore, if you please, Taylor."</p>

<p>"Ah! she is no Lady Ennismore, miss, unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
she has her proper situation in this house.
As to my lord, miss, I assure you the footmen
speak of him in a very odd way."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"Why one of them said openly at supper the
word 'ass,' Miss Wetheral; and another said he
couldn't follow his nose without the Lady Countess
at his side: they all pity poor Miss Julia,
and say she is too good for him."</p>

<p>"I shall tell papa, Taylor."</p>

<p>"Oh, gracious, Miss Wetheral! don't bring
me up about such things; I really couldn't appear,
upon my oath, before any one, for the
world. I must hold my tongue."</p>

<p>"No, speak on, Taylor: you must talk me to
sleep."</p>

<p>"Well, indeed, miss! The footman, Number
7, as they call him&mdash;for they are called out by
number, not by name&mdash;has been some years at Bedinfield;
and he says the Lady Countess had great
power over her husband, the late lord. She was
always bland and agreeable to speak to, if nothing
offended her, but Number 7 says it was a
sight to see her <i>angry</i>. She never forgave any
one, and will allow no one to differ with her.
Miss Julia is so gentle! that's one thing; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
will never offend; but if she ever does, Number
7 says it will be the worse for her."</p>

<p>"How can Number 7 tell any thing, Taylor?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Miss Wetheral, he says things very
hard to believe; but no one contradicted him.
He says his lady will never part with power till
she is in her grave, and that Miss Julia will only
lead a quiet life while she gives way. I think
my Lady Kerrison and my Lady Ennismore have
not done so well, miss, though they are quality.
I must say I should like to be first in my own
house&mdash;I should expect&mdash;if my husband&mdash;indeed,
says I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Taylor's words appeared broken, and they
gradually became extinct. Christobelle fell asleep
during her lengthy speech.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>


<p>Lady Ennismore and Julia were already in the
breakfast-room, when Christobelle and her father
descended the following morning. Lord Ennismore
was seated with a decanter of water on the
table before him; and he had sundry bottles
stationed round it, from which he weighed certain
powders, and immersed the whole in a
goblet of water. His lordship was too occupied
to rise upon their entrance, but he apologised
for the apparent want of gallantry.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Sir John Wetheral, and also I
entreat your pardon, Miss Wetheral, for my
sitting posture; but I am, at this moment, preparing
my morning draught. I shall, however,
have much pleasure in drinking your health,
when the preparation is completed."</p>

<p>"I will stand proxy to your words, my dear
Augustus," said the Countess; "I am anxious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
about the given quantities of the powders, and
entreat you to be careful in examining the measures.
Three grains, I know, is the proper
quantity. Three grains of each. My dear Miss
Wetheral, I hope you slept well. Sir John, I
am going to carry you with me per force, round
the park. Three grains only, my dear son."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear mother; I am very accurate:
I have just concluded my dose."</p>

<p>Lord Ennismore stood up with an air, which
he intended should be picturesque and gallant.
His lordship held the goblet in one hand, and a
tea-spoon in the other, as he bowed low to Christobelle
and her father.</p>

<p>"I have the honour to drink to your welfare,
as also to express our pleasure at your conferring
upon us the honour of your company." His
lordship then stirred the liquid into a state of
effervescence, and drank the contents of the
goblet. Julia extended her hand to receive the
empty goblet, but the Countess prevented the
action.</p>

<p>"No, my dear Julia, I will receive it from my
son. I know you are not fond of powders and
effervescing draughts; young people seldom like
them. Let me take the glass from your husband."
Her ladyship perceived the goblet was not quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
relieved of its contents. "My dear Augustus,
I am not easy. I wish I possessed the calmness
of Julia, but I never <i>shall</i> be so self-possessed;
I am always in little alarms about you. You
have left a wine-glassful in this goblet, and you
will not feel its beneficial effects."</p>

<p>Lord Ennismore's satisfaction was observable
at the care expressed by his mother's remarks.
Julia was totally ignorant of any concealed purpose
lurking in her ladyship's alarm. She only
smiled at her mother's perfectly unwarranted
fears, and playfully jested at their unfounded
use. The Countess patted Julia's cheek.</p>

<p>"My dear love, you cannot know a mother's
agonising, though, perhaps, foolish fears. A
young wife is not aware of the nature of unpleasing
symptoms, such as I fear I see arising
in my son's system. Sir John, I think we may
assert it as a fact, that a parent's anxiety is even
more keenly acute than a wife's alarm."</p>

<p>Sir John did not agree with her ladyship. He
thought parental pangs must be to every heart a
bitter trial; but a wife's welfare, or a husband's
health, must be a paramount interest. To his
idea, a mother's affection must bow to that of
a wife.</p>

<p>"You think so, Sir John?" The Countess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
smiled bewitchingly upon her son. "I believe I
did my duty to my lord; I think I devoted myself
to his wishes; but I surely feel a more intense
love for my son. Perhaps," continued the
Countess, sighing, "perhaps his very delicate
health interested my feelings too powerfully for
my repose."</p>

<p>"I am, and must be," said his lordship, in
most sententious tones, "extremely fortunate in
possessing a relation so interested in my well-doing.
I am sure my excellent wife feels for
me a proper and lively affection; but, as the
Countess-dowager remarks, there is want of reflection
in the young, which only the more aged
gain by experience."</p>

<p>"My dear lord," exclaimed Julia, with gentle
earnestness, "I should be the only proper attendant;
and I should be a most willing one,
too; if you would allow me to mix your medicines&mdash;but
Lady Ennismore has so frequently
assured me...."</p>

<p>"Come, come, my sweet Julia, away with
self-upbraidings, or upbraiding of any nature!
I bear witness to your worth and kindness; let
us proceed to despatch our breakfast, that I may
claim Sir John's company." The Countess allowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
no pause in the conversation to enable
Julia to continue her observation.</p>

<p>"Sir John, I look forward to great commendations
on your part. My son's taste is admirably
set forth in the new drive, which comprehends
a circuit of three miles. My dear
Miss Wetheral, you have a fine lady's appetite:
surely Bedinfield will effect a change. I am
sure my Julia will enjoy an hour or two of chat
with you, my young friend, while we are absent.
A little chat upon Wetheral topics. Julia talks
with so much fervour of her friends in Shropshire!"</p>

<p>"I wish they would all think of me with equal
interest, and become better correspondents," observed
Julia, energetically.</p>

<p>"Talking of correspondence," said the Countess,
addressing Sir John, "how few of our
earliest friends ever continue to keep up the delightful
intercourse of extreme youth. So many
new objects, so many new perceptions! We
rarely can long persevere in the course of our
early career."</p>

<p>"My daughter's friend makes the same remark.
Miss Wycherly complains of Julia's
silence," observed Sir John.</p>

<p>"I have written frequently, papa," cried Julia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
her whole figure becoming animated with the
subject. "I have even invited Penelope to Bedinfield,
without receiving an acceptation or denial.
What can my friend plead in extenuation of her
neglect? I did expect to be summoned to her
marriage. I promised to attend her summons."</p>

<p>"You did not inform me of this arrangement,
Julia," remarked the Countess; "I was not
aware of the intended pleasure of another visit
into Shropshire."</p>

<p>"I did not answer for <i>you</i>, dear mother. I
was not aware at that time of your intention to
reside at Bedinfield. I only assured Penelope,
Lord Ennismore, and myself, would swell her
train."</p>

<p>"You have changed your resolution, of course,"
said the Countess, in a dry tone of voice.</p>

<p>"No, indeed: I should like to surprise Penelope.
Papa, we will return with you to Wetheral,
if my lord has no objection."</p>

<p>"No plan can give me greater pleasure, my
love. Let us return together, if you please. If
your ladyship will add your society, Wetheral
will be proud to receive you. Lady Wetheral
will rejoice to see you."</p>

<p>"Oh! let us all return with papa," exclaimed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Julia, turning to her lord with eagerness; "let
us all return with papa to dear Wetheral!"</p>

<p>"I am sensible of Sir John's politeness," returned
his lordship, "more particularly as change
of air is beneficial to every constitution. I shall
with pleasure revisit Wetheral, if the Countess-dowager
has no engagements to prevent her
quitting Bedinfield."</p>

<p>"My dear mother, you are not engaged? You
will accompany us, won't you?" said Julia, affectionately
and eagerly.</p>

<p>"I am grieved that it is out of my power to
accept Sir John's polite invitation," replied the
Countess, with much suavity.</p>

<p>"Oh! I am so sorry! but, my lord, <i>you</i> will
take me to Wetheral; <i>you</i> will return with me
into Shropshire," continued Julia, anxiously
watching the stolid face of her dull lord. "You
have no engagement, Augustus?"</p>

<p>"None whatever, my dear Lady Ennismore,"
was his lordship's reply; "but if my mother cannot
postpone her engagements, we had perhaps
better defer our visit."</p>

<p>"I have every hope," said Sir John, bowing
politely to the Countess, "I have every hope
that Lady Ennismore will yet favour us with her
company. Perhaps, upon a little consideration,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
one or two engagements may give way, to do us
honour."</p>

<p>"I will consult with my son," replied the
Countess, with her most bewitching smile. "A
visit to Wetheral must be a pleasure too agreeable
to relinquish, if we can postpone less agreeable
engagements. I shall not fail to draw upon my
invention for excuses in <i>one</i> quarter. My dear
Julia, I hope we shall accomplish a visit to Wetheral.
I hope my lord's health will continue:
but I do not like his pallid complexion this
morning."</p>

<p>"Do I look unwell?" asked his lordship, in
an anxious tone, "do I appear changed to-day,
my dear mother?"</p>

<p>"I don't approve of that pale cheek, my dear
son. Julia, do you notice a little hectic spot&mdash;a
very small spot, just upon the cheek-bone?"</p>

<p>Julia looked at her lord's leaden face. "No,
I do not discover a spot, I cannot perceive a
hectic spot&mdash;do you, papa?"</p>

<p>"My dearest Julia, is it possible you cannot
distinguish a little feverish appearance? I see
it from this distance, with great uneasiness."</p>

<p>"Now, papa, you shall judge between us.
Do you see any appearance of spot or fever
upon my lord's cheek?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir John put on his glasses with an air of
grave solemnity. "Am I constituted judge in
this matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, papa, you shall declare the precise
state of the matter," exclaimed Julia, laughingly.</p>

<p>"No one must judge for <i>me</i>. No one can
judge for a mother's quick eye," said the
Countess, playfully, "but still in the multitude
of counsellors there is wisdom; therefore, I
should wish to hear Sir John's opinion."</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral examined Lord Ennismore's
cheek with great command of countenance:
there was no spot, or even the slightest
tinge of colour; all was colourless, still, and
heavy: dull, dismal, and disagreeable.</p>

<p>"My good lord," he said, "I am pleased to
join my daughter in her happy fearlessness;
and still better pleased to be able to soothe her
ladyship's apprehensions. I think there is nothing
alarming in your cheek. Rather pale,
but I can perceive no hectic tendency."</p>

<p>Lord Ennismore turned anxiously towards his
mother. Her eyes were fixed apprehensively
upon him: he turned towards Julia; she was
engaged with the merrythought of a chicken.
He again turned to the Countess.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear mother, you are not satisfied with
Sir John Wetheral's opinion: I see you think I
am unwell, and you are always watching me,
therefore, you understand my constitution better
than any one can do. I don't think I am very
well this morning. I could almost fancy my
head was uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"You never give way to fancy, my dear son,
therefore, you are not well. I can read the expression
of your poor heavy eyes this morning:
I am very uneasy." The Countess rose with
some perturbation from the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>Lord Ennismore rose also. "Excuse me,
Sir John Wetheral, excuse me, Miss Wetheral,
if I appear abrupt in quitting your company. I
will retire, if you please, this morning; I certainly
feel very unwell, and a few hours quiet
will be calming. Pray don't rise, Lady Ennismore;
my mother will give me her assistance to
my apartments; my dear mother, will you be so
kind as to give me an audience?"</p>

<p>Julia rose, and offered her arm to Lord Ennismore,
but he again declined her assistance. The
Countess approached with exultation in her looks
and manner; but soft words were upon her lips.</p>

<p>"I believe we old people are better fitted for
nurses, my dear Julia. Your alarm, perhaps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
would be greater than my own upon any emergency,
but an old head is more used to critical
situations. My dearest love, will you accompany
our friends into the sitting-room, and then
join us; you will be very anxious to see the
effect of my old-fashioned remedies. My dear
Sir John, I will see you again to arrange our
drive."</p>

<p>Lord Ennismore quitted the breakfast-room
with a look of real dejection. His valet, who
had been summoned, followed his lordship, as
he leaned upon the arm of the Countess. Her
implied suspicions had taken such deep root in
the weak mind of her son, that his imagination
led him to believe he was seriously ill. His
lordship walked softly, with the air of a person
who felt assured he had been suddenly seized
with an alarming and painful malady: his person
shrunk into greater insignificance, his eye wore
a more heavy expression&mdash;he was the perfect
illustration of Molière's "Malade Imaginaire,"
as he walked gently across the grandly-proportioned
apartment. What a creature to possess
a wife so lovely as Julia, and to be the representative
of the earldom of Ennismore! to own
the baronial halls of Bedinfield, and write himself
a man!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral would not let Julia depart
when they entered the sitting-room. He made
her take a seat by his side upon the sofa, and he
held her hand, while he gazed fondly upon her.
Julia smiled, and asked him "if he was examining
the hectic appearances upon <i>her</i> cheek."</p>

<p>"No, my child, here are no symptoms of
green and yellow melancholy; you look well,
Julia, therefore, you <i>must</i> be happy."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, I am indeed happy. Lady Ennismore
spoils me, and will not let me stir from
her side, 'lest the winds of heaven should blow
too roughly on my cheek.' She is all kindness."</p>

<p>"And Lord Ennismore is indulgent, Julia,
and makes you happy?"</p>

<p>"I wish he would not take so much medicine,
papa; otherwise, he never contradicts me in
anything. I cannot think it wholesome to
take such a quantity of medicine. The Countess
encourages him, I think."</p>

<p>"You love him, Julia?"</p>

<p>"Yes, pretty well, papa. Mamma told me I
should like him better and better every day,
when I was once married, but I can't say that is
quite the case. I like Lord Ennismore, though:
he never offends me, except in the quantity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
pills and powders. I don't like him <i>better</i>, but
then I don't think I like him worse."</p>

<p>"You are anxious to visit Wetheral again, my
love?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, papa, I am. I want to find out why
my friends have been silent. Mamma has behaved
very ill: she has never written me a line,
though I addressed her every month. I can't
imagine what my friends are made of. The
Countess warned me of all this."</p>

<p>"What can Lady Ennismore prophecy, who
is so distantly known to your friends, Julia?"</p>

<p>"She tells me, papa, that every body is envious
of my marriage, and that my friends will
fall away, because all youthful friendships are
hollow. Penelope has, indeed, proved how little
my letters interest her."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Julia," exclaimed Christobelle,
"Miss Wycherly has not received one letter
from Bedinfield. She told me so very sorrowfully
at Hatton."</p>

<p>"I cannot think that," returned her sister.
"The Countess herself took my letters to seal,
and order them to be put into the post-bag. Penelope
must have received them, but she is preparing
for her marriage, and Charles Spottiswoode
engrosses her attention."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, indeed, Julia; remember Miss Wycherly's
message by papa."</p>

<p>"I cannot understand it all," replied Julia,
as the tears rushed to her eyes; "I love all my
friends dearly, but now I am Countess of Ennismore
not a soul thinks of me, to keep up a correspondence.
Mamma told me that rank bought
every thing, yet I cannot purchase a line from
my own home, 'to bid God bless me.' I am
very unhappy about it sometimes, only Lady
Ennismore comforts me, and says she loves me
for a hundred friends."</p>

<p>"Think no more of it, my love, we shall be
all united at Wetheral soon, and you shall lecture
Penelope before us in conclave." Sir John
pressed Julia to him as he spoke. She smiled
through her tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are <i>all</i> included in my coming lecture!
You are <i>all</i> delinquents! I thought I
should have fainted when I heard of your arrival
yesterday, so unexpectedly! I was flying down
to you, but dear Lady Ennismore arrested my
flight. She made me lie down, and take some
of my lord's horrid drops. She advised me, too,
to receive you in the drawing-room; it was
more becoming my station, and your demerits.
I forgot station and demerits, when I heard your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
dear name, papa." She threw her arms round
her father's neck, and proceeded. "What care
I for any one, like my own dear papa? I know
I should be fonder of Lord Ennismore if he was
not always mixing up draughts and lotions, and
if he was more with me; but his rooms are near
Lady Ennismore, and mine are in the left wing
of this immense place."</p>

<p>"You do not mean to infer, my love, that
you have separate apartments!" said her father,
starting up from the sofa. "Four months of
matrimony, and a separation already, Julia!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's an old affair now, papa. Lord
Ennismore had his rooms prepared near Lady
Ennismore these three months, because he
thought she understood the pennyweights and
grains better than I do. I only see my lord at
meals, and he is extremely attentive to me then,
I must say; but I cannot like him as I should
do if he consulted <i>me</i> about his medicines. I
should learn the weights and measures in time,
you know."</p>

<p>Sir John walked to the window, without
making any reply. The Countess entered the
room at the moment; she spoke kindly and
feelingly to her daughter; at the same time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
taking both her hands, and pressing them with
affectionate solicitude.</p>

<p>"My dear love, my lord is inquiring for you:
he feels better, much better, but I have decided
upon sending for Dr. Anstruther. He wishes
you to sit with him; he inquires for Julia upon
all occasions, and I am now come for you. My
son is full of regrets," added her ladyship, turning
towards her guests, "that he should feel
one of his little seizures at this particular moment,
when he wished to do the honours of
Bedinfield; but he deputes me to act for him.
He has insisted upon my ordering the <i>barouchette</i>,
to drive Miss Wetheral and yourself to the plantations.
My dear son will hope to be perfectly
well at dinner: he is quite nervous about the
plantations."</p>

<p>Sir John appeared too engrossed with his own
emotions to reply; but he bowed to her ladyship's
speech. She turned to Christobelle.</p>

<p>"My dear young friend, we shall return to
luncheon, therefore, as my daughter remains
with her husband, you will, probably, be glad
to accompany us in our drive. We shall set out
in half an hour."</p>

<p>Christobelle promised herself little pleasure in
the drive, since Julia would not be with them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
but she would prepare to attend her ladyship's
summons. The two ladies then proceeded towards
the hall. Julia looked back at her father,
as he seated himself near Christobelle, and
smiled.</p>

<p>"Papa, I shall find out about the letters from
Lady Ennismore. I am sure Penelope is
wrong!"</p>

<p>"What is this little affair, Julia?" asked Lady
Ennismore, with peculiar quickness.</p>

<p>"My friends say they have received no letters
from Bedinfield, my dear mother. <i>You</i> know
I wrote, for you were kind enough to seal my
long crossed epistles. You told me they would
serve me so!"</p>

<p>"I have often known fluctuations in correspondence
among young people, my love. I
used to fancy in my youth that I was particularly
ill-used; but, when I look back, I perceive
it was circumstances which over-ruled many
events."</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore continued speaking to Julia,
but the distance prevented the substance of her
remarks reaching her friends. Before the speech
concluded, however, they had gained the door,
which Lady Ennismore closed after their transit,
and the subject was never more renewed. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
heavy sigh from her father arrested Christobelle's
attention. She asked him if he was ill.</p>

<p>"Not in body, my dear child: my mind alone
is wretched."</p>

<p>"Oh, why, papa?" she exclaimed, in surprise;
"what makes you wretched in this beautiful
place of Julia's? and Julia herself so well and
happy!"</p>

<p>"There is no happiness with that dangerous
woman, and that feeble son!" said her father,
as he paced the room. "There is no peace for
my poor child&mdash;ignorance, ignorance is her only
earthly chance! Why was I so weak, so deluded,
to marry my poor child to a wretched
idiot?"</p>

<p>"Papa," Christobelle uttered gently&mdash;"dear
papa, who are you meaning?"</p>

<p>He did not hear her speak; her father apparently
forgot her presence, for he continued
walking.</p>

<p>"To give way to a woman's tears, when my
judgment recoiled at the union, was folly, was
wickedness. My heart will feel this, for I knew
it was wrong, yet I sanctioned it by my presence.
My poor Julia!&mdash;my poor, poor girl!"</p>

<p>Christobelle could not bear to hear her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
father's self-reproach; she went to him and took
his hand.</p>

<p>"Papa," she said, "don't say you have done
wrong; you never did wrong to any body. We
all say how good and kind you are to us."</p>

<p>He stopped and looked earnestly at her.</p>

<p>"I have brought you up, Chrystal, with very
different principles. I do not think <i>you</i> will
bring me in sorrow to the grave. I think you
will not sell yourself to perjury and ambition,
as others have done."</p>

<p>"I will never do what you tell me not to do,
papa."</p>

<p>"I hope not&mdash;I hope not, my child. I tell
you not to marry a selfish, heartless man, as
Clara and Julia have done, to secure wealth and
rank, which they will never enjoy in peace&mdash;which
they will never enjoy in respectability.
It is a hard fate, but even the young must endure
it if they barter peace for riches. God
help them! their poor mother has done this, and
I did not act a father's part by them!" Sir
John seated himself, and Christobelle knelt by
him, and held his hand to her lips, and kissed it
repeatedly. He was recalled to recollection by
this movement, and he raised her from the attitude
she had chosen, to a seat by her side.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear Chrystal, never repeat the remarks
to any third person, which you have heard now
from my lips. Remember the trust I have in
your youth, because you have been my companion,
and have learned to be silent, and to
think a parent's word sacred. You will understand
my distress of mind at a future period;
but at this moment the knowledge of my suffering
would be incomprehensible to you. In your
steadiness of character I hope for much comfort
hereafter."</p>

<p>Christobelle did indeed hope to be his comfort
in age, as he had been her shield in youth. Her
words were simple, and her expressions were
uttered with untutored energy, but they were sincere
in feeling. His society, his kindness, his information,
had been her happiness; for they had
shielded her from a mother's reproaches, and
her increasing loss of self-command. They had
preserved her from ambitious feelings, by withdrawing
her from her mother's influence; and,
by offering her the calm pleasures of his study,
instead of consigning her first young days to
the infected air of Thompson's room, and Thompson's
arguments, Christobelle had known only
indulgence and gentle treatment. How could
she help loving this estimable parent, or fail to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
make his slightest wish the law of her heart?
She did promise&mdash;and redeemed that promise&mdash;that
she would never breathe to a human being
the conversations which he entrusted to her
sacred keeping.</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore was true to her appointment.
She did the honours of the new drive with infinite
grace, and conversed with Sir John upon
every subject with fluent and astonishing information.
Her ladyship appeared quite equal
to guide the destinies of Bedinfield. Every improvement
originated with herself, however carefully
she subscribed Lord Ennismore's name to
the plans; and her perfect acquaintance with
agricultural economy proved her equal to the
task of superintending her son's immense property.
Christobelle was delighted with the
polite tact of her manners, as she directed her
conversation from John to herself. It is assuredly
a great gift to possess that polite ease,
and well-directed attention, which gives a flattering
unction to the vanity of all who receive its
plastic touch. It is the wand of a fairy which
turns words into the pearls and diamonds of the
little tale&mdash;which does so delightfully</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wash, and comb, and lay us down softly."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No one could exceed Lady Ennismore in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
most fascinating, most dangerous gift of attraction.
Christobelle felt under its spell, bound
towards her by the silent and potent effects of
soothed vanity. She felt she was of equal consideration
with her father in Lady Ennismore's
eyes; for her opinions were elicited, and listened
to with marked attention. Christobelle was raised
above the level of her understanding&mdash;she was
gratified&mdash;she was delighted with Lady Ennismore.
The dull drive which had been anticipated,
passed pleasantly, even rapidly, to her
charmed feelings; and Sir John confessed to
her, that he could not feel surprised at her ladyship's
powerful influence over the unsuspicious
and gentle heart of Julia.</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore was equally fascinating at
luncheon. She did not partake of the delicacies
which tempted the eye, and impelled appetite;
but her lively conversation almost recompensed
them for the absence of Julia, whose
excuses she tendered. "Lord Ennismore was
certainly very unwell; he was suffering much
pain in the head. His dear Julia never left her
son when he had those wretched attacks. He
could not endure her to be a moment from his
sight; but she had deputed her to give her best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
love to both dear relations, whom she hoped to
meet at dinner, or at least, in the evening."</p>

<p>But Julia did not appear at the promised
hour. "Lord Ennismore's symptoms increased.
Dr. Anstruther was of opinion his patient was
preparing for another of those alarming attacks.
She greatly feared Julia would be confined to a
sick room many days, but her son was so eagerly
bent upon receiving every thing from Julia's
hand&mdash;so attached to his lady, it was delightful
to witness such conjugal affection. Lord Ennismore
almost increased the disorder, by regretting
his inability to see his agreeable guests:
the next visit to Bedinfield, her ladyship trusted,
would be free from such a painful interruption
of intercourse."</p>

<p>The evening passed away, and Julia did not
appear. It <i>did</i> seem strange that she could not
make her escape to her family for a quarter of
an hour. Why was Lord Ennismore so anxious
for his lady's society, so very much attached as
his mother represented him to be, and yet allow
her apartments to remain at such a distance from
his own? Why was not his attachment manifested
in that love for her society which would make
them inseparable, like the Boscawens, like the
Pynsents, nay, even like the unhappily assorted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Kerrisons? Surely, Julia might be replaced by
the anxious mother, while she visited at intervals
her own father! Christobelle was infinitely
astonished at Julia's complete seclusion with
Lord Ennismore, for she knew her strong affection
to her own family, and the little anxiety
she could suffer for a man whom she professed
to like "pretty well!" This was not love, to
compel that devotion of time and thought to her
husband's comforts which Anna Maria would
have shown to her honest-hearted and beloved
Tom Pynsent. It was a line of conduct
Christobelle could not comprehend, and her
father did not enlighten her on the subject,
when she expressed her sentiments to him at
parting for the night. He doubtless felt and
understood the whole system pursued by the
Dowager Countess to sustain her power at Bedinfield;
but Christobelle was too young to be
initiated in the wiles of the human heart, and
she wept to think her sister could absent herself
so long from those who loved her, and who had
journeyed so far to enjoy her presence.</p>

<p>The second morning's meal was ungraced by
Julia still. Lord Ennismore was even "seriously"
indisposed; and her ladyship spoke with feeling,
and at great length, of her own parental anxiety.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Her mind was torn to pieces with agitation and
alarm. She fancied sometimes, the mild air of
the South of Italy would be necessary to the
recovery of her son's health. Julia would be
so confined at Bedinfield, she thought. The
bright climate of Rome or Naples would be
beneficial to both her children, and, perhaps,
brace her own nerves. She had talked to Dr.
Anstruther upon the subject, and he quite went
with her in her ideas of Rome. "What did her
dear Sir John think?"</p>

<p>Sir John could form no opinion. He was
not acquainted with the nature of the attacks
which afflicted Lord Ennismore, and Julia's
health was excellent, if he was to judge by her
blooming and healthy complexion.</p>

<p>"True, my dear sir; Julia does indeed give
evidence of health, and a tranquil mind. I am
most happy in the knowledge, indeed in her
own assurance, that her heart is free from care.
I have spoken to her this morning, and she
seems delighted with the prospect of a continental
tour. I am very uneasy about my son."</p>

<p>"Have you had medical advice from town,
Lady Ennismore?"</p>

<p>"No: Dr. Anstruther is remarkably clever.
My son, as well as myself, pin our faith upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
his advise. I am never easy without Dr. Anstruther.
We could not consult a more intelligent
medical adviser."</p>

<p>"As I purpose leaving Bedinfield early to-morrow
morning, your ladyship may perhaps...."</p>

<p>"My dear friend, you must not quit us in this
hurried way! Surely you do not leave Bedinfield
so soon!" The Countess spoke in tones
of regret, but her eyes betrayed her pleasurable
feelings. "I must mourn my son's illness, since
it removes you from us. The next visit must
be at some moment more favourable to all
parties. This has been an unfortunate occurrence.
I must lament this very unfortunate
occurrence."</p>

<p>"I wish to see my daughter before I quit
Bedinfield," said Sir John Wetheral, with
seriousness of look and manner. "I must see
my daughter before I return to Wetheral:
probably she will not be so closely confined
to-day."</p>

<p>"I hope not&mdash;I will try to hope not," replied
the Countess; "but my fears will not allow me
to be tranquil. When our breakfast is concluded,
I will visit our invalid again, and, if
possible, release my dear Julia. She is very
watchful and attentive, dear creature. I cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
wonder at Ennismore's anxiety to have her with
him. We will see what this hour has produced."</p>

<p>Breakfast was concluded in silence. The
Countess lost her lively flow of spirits, and Sir
John did not contribute his usual portion of
pleasant conversation. The trio gradually became
silent and sad, and Lady Ennismore, politely
expressing her hopes that they should yet
alter their intention of leaving Bedinfield, rose
to visit her son. She hoped Julia might return
to them, when she was with the dear invalid, to
take her place; but, if a short time intervened,
she trusted they would find amusement in the
stores of the library, or in perambulating the
grounds. All and every thing was at their command.</p>

<p>The father and daughter were alone for some
hours. Each moment, as it sped rapidly on, was
full of hope that Julia was on her way to gladden
their sight, and delight their hearts; but, as
time were on, they feared some evil accident had
befallen the unfortunate Lord Ennismore. The
door at last opened, and the same attendant, who
appeared at their entrance into Bedinfield, again
presented herself.</p>

<p>"The Countess of Ennismore regrets the necessity
of her absence, Sir John, but she cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
quit my lord's apartment. I am deputed to bear
her compliments, and the regret of the young
Lady Ennismore. The Countess commands me
to say the carriages are at your disposal, and her
ladyship trusts you will excuse her presence till
the hour of dinner."</p>

<p>"I fear his lordship is very unwell," observed
Sir John, fixing his eyes upon the unwelcome
messenger with an expression of strong disbelief
in her statement; but she avoided meeting
his gaze.</p>

<p>"I am commanded to unfold my message to
Sir John Wetheral, but I was not authorised to
speak beyond its purport. I must now return
to her ladyship."</p>

<p>"Stay one instant," resumed Sir John, "and
take back my answer. Tell your lady, I will
not occupy the time and services, which appear
to be required on Lord Ennismore's part. I will
order my carriage immediately; but I wish for
one moment to take leave of my daughter, Lady
Ennismore, ere I leave her to the mournful task
of watching by her patient. My daughter and
myself are useless, since our exertions cannot
benefit Lord Ennismore. I wish to see my
daughter, if you please; and I shall be obliged
by your conveying my wishes to one of her
people."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>The attendant of Lady Ennismore retired, and
they were again two hours without receiving any
interruption. The carriage had been some moments
at the door, and Sir John was walking up
and down the room with hasty steps, when a
note was presented to him, upon a silver waiter,
by Lady Ennismore's footman.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 2em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dear Sir John,</p>

<p>"I cannot wonder at your flight&mdash;this is a
place of sorrow and sickness, unfit for the healthy
and happy. May we meet soon again! Julia
and myself dare not quit for a moment our
beloved and suffering invalid&mdash;he is in great
torment.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">"Yours most truly,</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 2em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<span class="smcap">E. Ennismore</span>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sir John Wetheral rang the bell: a brief
pause, and the footman reappeared.</p>

<p>"Is Dr. Anstruther at this moment in the
house?"</p>

<p>"I believe the doctor is now with my lord,
Sir John."</p>

<p>"I wish to see Dr. Anstruther the instant he
quits Lord Ennismore's apartment."</p>

<p>The servant bowed, and disappeared.</p>

<p>"This is hopeless and helpless," observed Sir
John; "I can only increase Julia's distress, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
remaining at Bedinfield. What use will it be to
inquire into the machinations of the Countess,
except to reap bitterness, and perceive my inability
to rouse the torpid character of her son.
My poor Julia's fate depends upon that artful
woman's will. It is vain to look on, and witness
that which I cannot control."</p>

<p>"But Lord Ennismore is very ill, papa," exclaimed
the sorrowing Christobelle. "Lord
Ennismore is very ill, and Julia cannot leave him
to bid us farewell! Will he die, papa?"</p>

<p>Sir John made no reply to the hurried question.
He was struggling with his own emotions.
He led his daughter in silence through the file
of footmen in the hall to the entrance-door,
where his carriage waited, already packed and
surmounted by Taylor. Hornby advanced to
inform him of Dr. Anstruther's departure from
Bedinfield; he had driven away before Sir John's
message had been delivered to him. Sir John
made no remark; he handed Christobelle into
the carriage, and ordered the door to be closed:
he did not enter it himself. Christobelle entreated
him to join her. "My dear papa, where
are you going to ride?"</p>

<p>"In the rumble, my love: the air will do me
good. Take Taylor inside."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>The exchange was made quickly. Sir John
took possession of the rumble, which enabled him
to commune with his own thoughts in silence,
and they quitted for ever the magnificent home,
which Julia's fatal ambition had preferred to the
happy days of her singlehood, in the less courtly
domain of Wetheral Castle. They left, for ever,
the towers of Bedinfield, its wooded hills, its
calmly beautiful and luxuriant scenery: they
never more beheld its ancient walls, or visited
the home of Julia's choice. In ten days after
Sir John Wetheral's return into Shropshire, the
Bedinfield establishment, including Dr. Anstruther,
were on their road to Florence, and it was
said Lord Ennismore's health had compelled the
sudden and silently arranged movement.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XX.</h2>


<p>A twelvemonth passed by, unmarked by any
event, save the marriage of Miss Wycherly. Mr.
and Mrs. Charles Spottiswoode resided at Lidham,
and Sir John Spottiswoode had returned to
England, to inhabit his almost desolate property
in Worcestershire. Lady Spottiswoode and her
daughter were invited to remain with him at
Alverton, to enliven his home, till he could endow
it with a wife; but Sir John's fastidious
taste gave little promise to the gay partakers of
Lady Spottiswoode's festivities, that she would
be restored to her once agreeably filled jointure-house,
in the Abbey Foregate.</p>

<p>Worcestershire, also, lay wide and far between
the growing loves of Miss Spottiswoode and Mr.
John Tyndal; but there was resolution on his
side, and encouragement on the part of the lady;
and the repeated absences of Mr. John Tyndal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
from Court Herbert, gave rise to much observation
and prophecy in their circle. The Tom
Pynsents were at Hatton, rejoicing in the prospect
of an heir to its prosperity; and Mrs.
Pynsent's ecstasy could only be equalled by the
anxiety she manifested to keep Anna Maria's
mind easy. Her whims, in every respect, were
to be met with instant fulfilment. Mrs. Pynsent
formed a most amusing contrast to the fearful
Miss Tabitha Boscawen.</p>

<p>Christobelle was domesticated at Hatton a
fortnight before her sister's expected confinement.
Her father rejoiced in her visits, for she
was then withdrawn from her mother's increasing
petulance&mdash;a petulance, which began to vent its
puerile vehemence upon every being within her
power, and which fell upon Christobelle with
peculiar violence.</p>

<p>The extremity of her ladyship's patience had
given way under repeated disappointments connected
with Bedinfield and Ripley. Those
matches, which she had most fondly considered
her own scheme, prosecuted to their close, by her
own determination and skill, in the very face of
her husband's objections, had given her no satisfaction.
Bedinfield was now deserted by her
daughter for a foreign land; and Sir Foster
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Kerrison had interdicted the meeting of Clara
and her mother at Ripley. He considered Lady
Wetheral an aider and abettor of his wife's violent
spirit; and, having once forbidden the presence
of her ladyship within the walls, the gibing
and bitter reproaches of Clara strengthened and
decided his prohibition. Vexed and irritated by
these occurrences, Lady Wetheral could not turn
her attention to her happily-established Anna
Maria, or the gay-hearted Isabel, with her darling
child: she forbade Christobelle ever offending
her ears with sounds so repugnant to her taste.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, Bell. I do not choose
to be lectured by a pert girl of thirteen. What
is Tom Pynsent to me? I detest a man who
can tamely bear to live shut up with those people
at Hatton; and who can bear the avarice of
Boscawen, driving a stupid pair of horses, when
he can so well afford four? Those were your
father's matches, not mine."</p>

<p>"I thought you particularly wished Tom Pynsent
to propose to Anna Maria, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, Bell."</p>

<p>Christobelle was happy to escape from the
cares of Wetheral, to the perfect freedom of
Hatton. Provided every one spoke their mind,
and that mind was free from mean pride, Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Pynsent was content. Her good-humour to those
she loved was proverbial, as her detestation of
folly was public. Luckily, Christobelle was
ranked among her favourites at her first visit.</p>

<p>"You young thing, so you are come to
Hatton, are you? Shake hands. I shall like
<i>you</i>, because you showed a good feeling about
your dare-devil sister Kerrison, some time ago.
I like warm-hearted people, without nonsense
and pride&mdash;here's a welcome to you, you great,
tall, good-looking thing." Mrs. Pynsent wrung
her hand with a good will, which gave severe
pain. Christobelle tried to smile.</p>

<p>"What, my welcome is rough, is it? Make a
face at once, and don't pretend you are pleased,
when you are no such thing. There's your sister&mdash;she's
a proper little tub&mdash;and there's Tom, as
handsome as ever&mdash;and here's my Bobby, with
the gout; but you may go and shake hands with
him. The poor soul can't wag from the sofa."</p>

<p>Christobelle was received affectionately by all
and each. Mrs. Pynsent was full of kind inquiries.
Some fell kindly upon her young friend's
heart, and some remarks had better have been
left unsaid.</p>

<p>"Well, and how is your father, my young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
one? A better creature never walked this earth
than Sir John. How is he?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, and desires his compliments."</p>

<p>"Ay, to be sure&mdash;and my lady, how is she?"</p>

<p>"I left mamma very unwell."</p>

<p>"Too-too! she can't be ill. Hasn't she married
her daughters to two mad scamps, that her
heart was set upon? What is she ill about?
Can't she get <i>you</i> off, just yet, that she is so
dull? She had better throw you at Selgrave's
head. Well, and how is my pretty Mrs. Boscawen?"</p>

<p>Christobelle gave Mrs. Pynsent a full account
of Isabel's health, and her happiness at Brierly.</p>

<p>"Very proper; I am glad to hear it. That
was your father's match, missy. He valued a
good man. Lord, Tom, what are you doing there,
with Anna Maria?"</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent was removing a basket of apricots
from his lady's vicinity.</p>

<p>"I won't let my wife eat these unripe things,
to make herself ill, and bring on all sorts of queer
feelings. Upon my soul, you have eaten six half-ripe
apricots; you have eaten sour things enough
to kill an old fox, much less a little delicate
creature like yourself."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just one apricot more, Tom," said Anna
Maria, coaxingly.</p>

<p>"By Jove, I'll throw them out to the dogs,
Anna! You shall not eat such trash."</p>

<p>"Just <i>one</i> more, Tom," continued his lady,
advancing her hand towards the basket, and
looking half-beseechingly, half-saucily, at him.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, you are enough to drive a
man distracted! I declare you are more trouble
to me than the kennel!" cried Tom Pynsent, unable
to resist her <i>minauderie</i>, and again surrendering
the basket of apricots to her grasp. "I'm
sure I hope this won't happen every time."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha," cried Mrs. Pynsent, "and that's
the fear, is it, Master Tommy? Give up the
fruit, and let her eat as much as she likes. Do
you remember, Bobby, how I gobbled your pines,
once upon a time?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pynsent looked up from his newspaper,
and shrugged his shoulders. "I remember a
good deal, Pen."</p>

<p>"I'll be bound you do, Bobby."</p>

<p>Anna Maria now expressed a wish to walk
with her sister into the flower-garden. Tom
rather demurred at her descending the long
flight of steps. Mrs. Pynsent would allow no
opposition.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come now, Tommy, let the poor thing hobble
about, if she wishes it; and, if she drops
down, pick her up again. I hate a poor unfortunate
woman to be refused any thing. I am
sure it's no sinecure to be such a roundabout."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent was easily persuaded into measures
which he endured pain in refusing to his
lady. His affectionate heart was only anxious to
do right by a creature, whose very footsteps he
worshipped; and his watchfulness proceeded
from the fear of losing that which was dearer to
him than light or life. Anna Maria revelled in
the very wantonness of happiness, and she delighted
in drawing forth her husband's attentions,
by every little inventive art. She loved
also to rouse his alarms; and enjoyed, with rapturous
delight, the expression of his honest affection.</p>

<p>One morning, as the ladies sat at work, amused
by Tom's account of the progress of his kennel,
Anna Maria suddenly sank back upon the sofa,
and, by her closed eyes, and the work falling
from her hands, Mrs. Pynsent did indeed fear
some fatal termination to her son's hopes. Tom
Pynsent sat rooted to the spot; his clasped
hands and trembling lips exhibiting every appalling
alarm. Mrs. Pynsent and Christobelle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
flew to Anna Maria's assistance; but the apparently
dying victim opened her eyes, and laughed
heartily, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear Tom, I wanted to see how you
would look at my death; come to me, Tom, and
don't look so overpowered."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent flew to her, as the blood rushed
violently into his face, by the reaction of hope
against the horrors of despair. He threw his
arms round her, as she looked half terrified at
her own thoughtlessness.</p>

<p>"By all that's horrible, Anna Maria, never
give me such a useless fright again; I might
have had an apoplectic stroke. How could you
play me such a devil's trick?"</p>

<p>She stroked his cheek, as she whispered, "I
just wanted to amuse myself, Tom."</p>

<p>"Yes, it might amuse <i>you</i>, but what sort of
amusement was it to me? What would you
have done, if I had dropped down dead with the
shock?"</p>

<p>"Cried, Tom," answered Anna Maria, putting
her finger to her eye, and looking demure. Tom
Pynsent looked at her with admiring affection.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, if you play me this trick
again, I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>Anna Maria placed her hand upon his lips,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and a little playful scene ensued, which ended
in the usual way. It gave the happy wife the
delight of witnessing her husband's sincere alarm
and love, and Tom Pynsent was charmed with
the little ruse, which gave a zest to the day's
routine. "It was," he said, "one of those sly
tricks which his little wife acted so prettily,
doubling and harking back, like a knowing
vixen fox. He thought a wife and a fox were
devilish alike in their politics."</p>

<p>It was a pleasing sight to witness the happy
understanding which prevailed among the members
composing the family circles at Hatton. If
Mrs. Pynsent failed&mdash;and fail she assuredly did,
in the elegances of polished life&mdash;yet her domination
was kindly wielded over those who lived
under her roof. She respected and loved her
husband, though his cognomen of "Bobby"
threw a shade of ridicule round her gentlest expostulations.
She loved her Tom with that blind
enthusiastic fondness which extended itself to
every thing connected with him. She loved his
wife, because she belonged to Tom&mdash;the dogs
were Tom's dogs&mdash;Bobby was Tom's father.
Hatton would, eventually, belong to Tom; therefore,
her heart warmed to every one around her.
Was not Christobelle also a favourite? Had she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
not come to Hatton to <i>see</i> Tom?&mdash;Mrs. Pynsent
cautioned Anna Maria not to repeat her fainting-fit,
or trench upon the sacred ground of her husband's
feeling heart too closely; at present she
was safe, and Tom was pleased, so it did not
signify.</p>

<p>"The deuce take the best of them, my dear;
if they are often called upon for sorrow, it
hardens them, as the cold air stiffens your sticks
of lollypops. Tommy is but a man, after all;
and the dog must be amused, not frightened.
What an owl he looked, bless his heart!"</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode appeared suddenly at
Hatton. He was staying at Lidham, and excursing
among his friends in Shropshire. Mrs.
Pynsent insisted upon Sir John becoming their
guest, and enforced her request in her usual
quaintly expressive style.</p>

<p>"Here, hollo, Sir Jacky, you can't think of
leaving us at the rate of a sneaking call! Make
yourself at home, man; and stay with us till
Tom's wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>An earnest look of entreaty from Anna Maria
checked the rapidity of Mrs. Pynsent's speech.
She hesitated.</p>

<p>"Stay with us, Sir Jacky, till&mdash;I'll be hanged
if I know what I was going to say!&mdash;if you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
haven't put every thing out of my head, Anna
Maria. What did you think I was going to
say? I wasn't going to talk like Sally Hancock."</p>

<p>"Stay with us, Spottiswoode," cried Tom
Pynsent, "and we'll have a field-day; such a
one as you never saw in Italy."</p>

<p>"Oh, those outlandish places, and those
snivelling Frenchmen!" exclaimed Mrs. Pynsent:
"come to us, and here's a pretty girl,
worth all your mamzells."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent pointed Sir John Spottiswoode's
attention to Christobelle. The timid girl felt
a poignant shame, which caused deep blushes to
suffuse her face and neck, and she placed herself
behind Anna Maria, till an opportunity offered
to escape from the room. When she returned
Sir John had departed, but he was to become a
guest at Hatton for some days, on the following
morning. He was to accompany Mr. Wycherly
and the Charles Spottiswoodes to dinner. Mrs.
Pynsent rallied Christobelle upon her flight from
the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Why, hollo, my young one, you seem to
shrink under a little notice. That won't do for
my lady, some time hence. You must expect
notice now. Don't be a fool&mdash;an affected fool&mdash;or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
any thing of that kind; but you must expect
to hear yourself admired. Why, you're a
monstrous fine girl, and, if you don't beat Lady
Kerrison in a few years, my name is not Pen
Pynsent."</p>

<p>Christobelle blushed more deeply and painfully
than before.</p>

<p>"Come, Miss Bell, try to bear beauty without
reddening so furiously. Don't be argued into
selling it to the best bidder, and you need not
be ashamed of it."</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Wetheral," said the peaceable
Mr. Pynsent, "come and shelter yourself under
my wing."</p>

<p>"A pretty wing you have got to shelter her
with, Bobby."</p>

<p>Mr. Pynsent, to use a parliamentary expression,
"withdrew his motion," and Christobelle
was again exposed to his lady's jests.</p>

<p>"Now, I say, Sir Jacky would be a proper
sort of beau for you, Miss Bell. A long-legged
fellow, as steady as our best hound, with a nice
estate, and a good temper."</p>

<p>"I would rather not leave papa," answered
poor Christobelle, almost inclined to weep.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent laughed heartily. "A good
joke this, for Jacky. I only mention it, my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
dear, to be beforehand with my Lady Wetheral.
When she tells you of Sir Jacky's estate, you
can say it came from <i>me</i> first. I recommended
the spec., mind. It will be droll enough if I get
before my lady, in a matrimonial speculation."</p>

<p>"Come, now, mother, don't tease my friend,
Bell," cried the kind-hearted Tom. "I won't
allow any teasing. I shall bespeak Bell for my
second wife; no one else shall have her."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Anna Maria, raising
her head from examining a painted screen.</p>

<p>"Why, Bell has promised to be my wife, the
very next time you die, you little rascal."
Anna Maria snapped her fingers at him with
a smile; Tom Pynsent snatched a kiss, and
proceeded.</p>

<p>"If any one teases sister Bell, I shall feel
called upon to take her part, so run and put on
your habit, Bell, and we'll have a scamper with
all the dogs."</p>

<p>Thus ended Christobelle's trouble and blushes;
and Mrs. Pynsent good-humouredly forbore to
distress her in future, by recurring to her appearance,
or extolling the fortune and long legs
of Sir John Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>When every species of joke was withdrawn,
which caused feelings of annoyance, Christobelle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
liked Sir John Spottiswoode's society. He had
travelled much; and she loved to listen to his
accounts of the places he had frequented, and
the objects he had observed with interest. Sir
John was sparkling in his descriptions, and he
saw that Christobelle lent an attentive ear to all
his communications; a flattering circumstance,
even though the listener proved a girl of thirteen.
They were the best friends in the world.
Christobelle loved to question him upon foreign
subjects, and his very easy manners made her
cast away gradually the alarm and restraint of
her first acquaintance with a man so much her
senior in age and mental acquirements. Sir
John had seen the Ennismores at Florence.
They were very gay, and Julia was considered
the loveliest Englishwoman in Florence. Her
society was greatly courted, and there was a
Colonel Neville who was deeply attached to her.
Every body pitied Colonel Neville. The Countess
encouraged his attentions to her daughter-in-law,
which made poor Neville's case more pitiable.
The young Lady Ennismore had given no occasion
for remark, for her conduct was unimpeachable,
but poor Neville was sacrificed. He
could not tear himself away, when Sir John
quitted Italy. He was lingering near Lady Ennismore.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
It must be a case of strong temptation,
he thought, for the young Countess. Neville
was a fine agreeable fellow, and Lord Ennismore
looked more fit for the grave. Pen Spottiswoode
was extremely uneasy about her old
friend.</p>

<p>In such interesting subjects, Christobelle's attention
was deeply fixed; and, whether they
rode or walked, she generally found herself by
the side of Sir John Spottiswoode. Mrs. Pynsent
winked her eye, if their glances met upon
these occasions, but she refrained from making
any remark, except by implication.</p>

<p>"I say, Miss Bell, if you would rather not
ride to-day with an elderly man, give me a hint,
and I'll get you off."</p>

<p>"Here, hollo, Miss Bell, don't do any thing
disagreeable to your mind. Shall Tom give you
his arm to-day? I dare say, like the rest of us,
you prefer variety."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent would not allow Christobelle to
return to Wetheral at the appointed time. "She
was a steady tight kind of a lass, and the deuce
a step should she make towards her dull home.
She need give herself no trouble. <i>She</i> would
settle the concern with Sir John. Christobelle
should stay over Tom's confinement&mdash;he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
suffer quite as much as his little wife&mdash;and
Jacky Spottiswoode should stay too. It would
make Tom comfortable, when madam was in the
straw."</p>

<p>So it was decided to be, and both continued
at Hatton, enjoying long walks, and assisting
each other in dispelling gloomy apprehensions
from the mind of the affectionate and anxious
husband. Tom Pynsent's apprehensions increased
as Anna Maria's hour drew near, and his mother
taxed her memory for calming and comfortable
precedents.</p>

<p>"Tom, don't drop your lip, like Sally Hancock.
Why, there's Kitty Barnes, with fifteen
enormous purple-faced children: she is alive at
this moment. And look at Polly Mudge, the
whipper-in's wife, who they thought must die;
isn't she hanging out the clothes, and handing
the baskets along, as brisk as your three year
olds?"</p>

<p>"Anna Maria is so delicate; one can't compare
her with Polly Mudge," said Tom Pynsent,
in doleful tones.</p>

<p>"Well, then, what do you say to Betty
Smoker, who always wanted bacon and greens,
an hour after her troubles were over. She was
a poor sickly-looking thing!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope my poor girl will do the same, if it's
a good thing for her," replied Tom, in more
cheerful accents.</p>

<p>"Let her eat and drink just what she likes,
Tom. I won't have her contradicted in any
thing."</p>

<p>At length, the day arrived which was to decide
the fate of Tom Pynsent. The moment Anna
Maria complained of feeling ill and restless, her
husband fled to the kennel, and insisted upon
some one bringing him intelligence every ten
minutes of his wife's health. Polly Mudge was
deputed to relieve guard with Christobelle; and
for nearly thirteen hours they were employed as
carrier-pigeons, to announce bulletins from Mrs.
Pynsent to the kennel, where Tom pertinaciously
resolved to remain. It was the only spot where
his mind could receive amusement, or which had
power to distract his attention from the idea that
his wife would not survive her confinement. He
took no nourishment. He continued constantly
employed with his men in examining the dogs,
and suggesting improvements for their convenience.</p>

<p>At length, as the shades of evening began to
fall, Mrs. Pynsent approached the kennel, waving
her pocket-handkerchief: it caught her son's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
eye as he was preparing to give "Rattler" and
"Beauty" a dose of salt. He bounded over the
wall, and gazed earnestly upon his mother's face.
She waved her handkerchief again in triumph,
and gave a powerful cheer. Tom caught up the
note, and it was re-echoed by the huntsmen, till
their voices rose far and wide upon the air.
Anna Maria had given birth to a son. Mrs.
Pynsent embraced her son in ecstatic delight,
and the tears ran down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"If it isn't as fine a boy as ever blessed my
sight! Go and change that coat, my blessed
Tom, and you shall see them both; but don't go
smelling of the kennel, my pretty one!"</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent's heart swelled with a husband's
and a father's best emotions, when he contemplated
his wife and child. It seemed as though
his Anna Maria had passed through death, and
was raised again to his eyes and heart. He
gazed silently upon them for some time in astonishment&mdash;he
gazed upon the infant, as it lay by
<i>her</i> side, who had suffered so much to give it
life. He turned to his mother, who watched the
workings of his countenance with delight, and,
seizing her hands, he exclaimed,</p>

<p>"If John Spottiswoode and myself don't drink
like fiddlers to-night, for this day's work!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>All was joy and congratulation at Hatton.
Mr. Pynsent, in spite of gouty pains, insisted
upon being carried to the door of his daughter's
apartment, that he might enjoy the satisfaction
of hearing his grandson cry. Mrs. Pynsent
would not hear of it.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Bobby, and nurse your crutch.
To-morrow you shall all see our little, squalling
puppy."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent did not drink like a fiddler with
John Spottiswoode. He remained the whole
evening in Anna Maria's dressing-room, listening
greedily to the movements of her attendants&mdash;to
the tone of her voice&mdash;and to the cry of the
newly-arrived object of his affections. There he
received refreshment, and he only left his station
to retire at a late hour to his own room.</p>

<p>Christobelle was allowed to ride with Sir John
Spottiswoode, to convey the intelligence to Wetheral
the following morning. It was vain to
hope for her brother-in-law's company: he was
never absent from his lady's room. Christobelle
was now quite unrestrained with her companion,
and to be escorted by him alone was delightful:
he could then attend to her, and she was free to
chat, without fearing a wink or nod from Mrs.
Pynsent. Her arrival, so attended, was pleasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
to Lady Wetheral, and Christobelle was welcomed,
for the first time in her life, with smiles
and kindness.</p>

<p>"My dear Bell, you are very kind to bring
me such good news; I am such a poor thing in
illness&mdash;so alarmed about those I love, that my
company would have been worse than useless to
dear Mrs. Tom Pynsent. Tell her how I rejoice
in my grandson. Sir John Spottiswoode, we
are very old acquaintance, though you have been
so long absent. I hope you have brought back
your affection for old friends?"</p>

<p>"Unchanged, Lady Wetheral, unchanged."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it. You have been staying
some time at Hatton, I think?"</p>

<p>"Nearly three weeks, attending very closely
upon Miss Wetheral, who has had no other
gallant."</p>

<p>"My daughter has been receiving pleasure, I
am sure."</p>

<p>"I won't answer for that: but I can answer
for her very polite reception of me, and that I
have received great pleasure from her conversation."</p>

<p>"Give a proof of your satisfaction, by staying
at Wetheral, Sir John. My husband will be full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of regret, if you quit Shropshire without paying
a visit to your old friends."</p>

<p>"I shall have pleasure in doing so, Lady Wetheral,
when I leave Hatton."</p>

<p>Her ladyship was greatly pleased by Sir John
Spottiswoode's alacrity in accepting her invitation.
Her manner wore its usual composure
under excitation, but her sentiments transpired
in the gentle suavity of her conduct towards
Christobelle. She was the "dear companion
whom she missed&mdash;the only relic of past times&mdash;the
child left to comfort her age, now all the
rest were gone far distant from her." Sir John
Spottiswoode felt compassion and interest in
her complaining affection. Christobelle knew
from experience, that her mother's manner proceeded
from some concealed motives, in which
she herself was involved. It could not possibly
proceed from any views which she might form
upon Sir John's liberty, because he counted five
and twenty years, and Christobelle was too
young to become a speculation; but she was assured
there must be some powerful reason to
effect such a startling change in her manner of
addressing her. Where was the "stupid, tiresome,
unloveable Bell" of their last meeting?
She was, like Sir John Spottiswoode, unchanged;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
but she was addressed as the creature who had
long been the only object of her mother's cares
and affection, since the marriage of Lady Kerrison.
This was incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral accompanied them in their
return to Hatton, and Mrs. Pynsent was eager
to exhibit her little charge. He was summoned
into the dressing-room, where the happy grandmother
was seated with the babe, preparing a
little soaked biscuit in a small silver saucepan.</p>

<p>"Come in, come in, good folks: come in, Sir
John Wetheral; here's a chap for you! Don't
squeeze the young dog! Sit down, Sir John.
Where's Tom? I'm just making a little meal
for our young dog! Tom says he shall be
christened 'Rattler;' but he shan't be named
after beasts that perish."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent came softly forth from Anna
Maria's room, and received his father-in-law's
warm congratulations. Sir John took the infant
tenderly in his arms, and gave it a blessing, as
he had done by the child of Isabel. Tom Pynsent,
almost purple in the face with happy feelings,
watched every movement of its arms and
eyes.</p>

<p>"Upon my soul, it's the prettiest thing I ever
saw! I do think, upon my soul, it is!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's just what you were at that age, Tommy,"
replied his mother, as she assisted the
nurse to prepare the biscuit; "it's just such a
little darling pudsey thing as <i>you</i> were."</p>

<p>Sir John was allowed to see Anna Maria for
one instant, to smile at her, but not to speak.
All were then driven from the dressing-room by
the mandate of Mrs. Pynsent.</p>

<p>"Off with you now, all of you. Wait in
peace till Tom's allowed to see company, and
then we will have rare doings."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral's visit was paid in great form,
a fortnight after the birth of Anna Maria's child,
and Christobelle was to return with her to Wetheral
when it was concluded. Mrs. Pynsent
could not endure the protracted visit of a person
equally related to the parties with herself.</p>

<p>"Such coolness," she observed to Sally Hancock,
who was sent for to see Tom's child&mdash;"such
cool ways of going on did not suit her
ideas; and be hanged if my Lady Wetheral
should see either mother or child!"</p>

<p>When her ladyship arrived at Hatton, Sir
John Spottiswoode and Christobelle were in the
drawing-room. She entered with graceful composure,
and in excellent spirits.</p>

<p>"My dear Bell, I come with increased pleasure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
knowing I am to run away with you. Sir
John Spottiswoode, how do you do? Drawing,
both of you, I see. Sir John's sketches must
be your models, my love. I hope to be favoured
with a sight of those sketches during your
promised visit at Wetheral, my dear sir."</p>

<p>"I was giving Miss Wetheral a few hints on
perspective."</p>

<p>"How very kind! My dear Bell, I hope you
do credit to your instructor. I hurried here
rather earlier than I generally drive out, in the
hope of seeing Anna Maria for a few minutes.
My Sir John assures me it is a lovely infant. I
am happy she is doing so well; no fever, I
hear; quite well, and with an appetite."</p>

<p>A polite and playful conversation was kept
up between her ladyship and Sir John Spottiswoode,
till Mrs. Pynsent appeared. She entered
the room with the short, sharp step which
always marked her dislike to the visitor.</p>

<p>"So you are come at last, my Lady Wetheral?
A fortnight is a long time to keep away from
one's flesh and blood!"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral appeared perfectly collected,
and unconscious of Mrs. Pynsent's rebuke. She
bowed with polite good-humour.</p>

<p>"I trust I shall find my daughter awake. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
long to be introduced to my grandson&mdash;my first
grandson, Mrs. Pynsent, for I have not yet seen
Isabel's boy."</p>

<p>"I would not have let a fortnight pass without
seeing my grandson at Brierly," replied
Mrs. Pynsent.</p>

<p>"My dear daughter can perhaps receive me
now," said Lady Wetheral, rising. "I am
anxious to see her."</p>

<p>"Your dear daughter is fast asleep, and so
is her infant."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral reseated herself.</p>

<p>"A few minutes may find her awake. I may
be fortunate enough to remain till she wakes."</p>

<p>"I don't think you will. Anna Maria has
fallen into her first sleep to-day, and I hope it
will last. The child is asleep with her, and Tom
watches over them."</p>

<p>"Her sleep is quiet and refreshing, I hope?"</p>

<p>"We take great care of our invalids at Hatton.
We don't leave them a fortnight to be
nursed by other people."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral affected innocence of all
covert meanings. She addressed Sir John Spottiswoode.&mdash;</p>

<p>"My daughter tells me you saw the Ennismore
party at Florence. Did you see my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
daughter, Lady Ennismore, to speak? Did she
trouble you with any letters or messages for her
friends?"</p>

<p>"I saw Lady Ennismore&mdash;your Lady Ennismore&mdash;twice;
each time she was accompanied
by the Countess and Colonel Neville, and our
interview was short. Lady Ennismore was
looking very lovely."</p>

<p>"You mentioned your intended return to
England to her."</p>

<p>"I did; but no letters were consigned to my
care by her ladyship."</p>

<p>"It is very strange," returned Lady Wetheral,
"that only one letter has reached us from
Italy within twelve months!"</p>

<p>"Every body expected it!" said Mrs. Pynsent.</p>

<p>"I do not understand&mdash;I cannot quite comprehend
your remark," replied her ladyship,
bending gently forward, and sinking gracefully
into her first attitude.</p>

<p>"Every body knew you had given your
daughter to a weak man, governed by his
mother; and every body expected the poor girl
would be carried from her friends. Who ever
heard of the old Lady Ennismore, and did not
learn that she was a tartar!"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral changed the subject.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have probably brought some beautiful
specimens of the different arts, Sir John? Italy
is full of rare antiquities."</p>

<p>"I have brought home a few things&mdash;a few
pictures, and so forth, as all travellers are expected
to do," replied Sir John Spottiswoode.
"I hope Miss Wetheral will accept a little drawing
of Naples, which I mean to present on one
knee."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral smiled.</p>

<p>"My dear Bell will receive your polite offering,
with a determination to persevere in drawing,
I am sure, Sir John."</p>

<p>"And our friend, Sir Jacky, is upon sale
too," cried Mrs. Pynsent. "Here he stands,
framed and glazed, for man&#339;uvring mothers to
contemplate!"</p>

<p>"Sir John Spottiswoode is worthy many man&#339;uvres,"
answered her ladyship. "Every
lady will be forgiven for wishing her daughter
happily engaged to worth and high principle."</p>

<p>Sir John bowed low, and looked gratified by
the compliment. Certainly Lady Wetheral
ably sustained her claims to good generalship.
She addressed Mrs. Pynsent.</p>

<p>"Perhaps my daughter may be awake; may I
be allowed to enter her room?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"No one enters her room but Tom. She is
not awake: I hope she will not think of it these
two hours."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral acted upon her own often-expressed
principle of never contending with
"vulgar people;" she, therefore, rose to depart,
and Christobelle unwillingly rose to accompany
her. She begged her kindest love to her son
and daughter.</p>

<p>"Yes, my Lady Wetheral, I'll tell my
daughter Tom, you have called at last," interrupted
Mrs. Pynsent.</p>

<p>"Her kindest love to Mr. and Mrs. Tom
<i>Pynsent</i>, and she hoped to be more fortunate at
a future visit."</p>

<p>"I'll tell Mrs. Tom, you will call in another
fortnight, my lady." Mrs. Pynsent advanced,
and took both Christobelle's hands. "You are
a good, clever, handsome, gawky girl, and I am
very sorry to lose you. Come whenever you like,
and stay as long as you like; you will be very
welcome at Hatton. You don't understand
man&#339;uvring yet, and I hope you never will.
Never lose your blushes, and never sell yourself
to the Evil One. Good bye, my dear, honest
Miss Bell."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent shook Christobelle's hands as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
warmly at taking leave, as she had done at her
entrance to Hatton; and her young friend departed
in lowness of spirits. Mrs. Pynsent had
shown her great kindness; and whenever her
warm heart interested itself, it was impossible
to resist her roughly expressed, but continual
demonstrations of good will. Sir John Spottiswoode
observed Christobelle's distress, as he
led her to the carriage, after having deposited
her mother.</p>

<p>"You are loth to depart, Miss Wetheral," he
said, with feeling.</p>

<p>Christobelle did not answer. The tears which
fell uncontrolled witnessed that she <i>did</i> feel unwilling
to quit the happy party. She entered
the carriage in a deplorable state of weeping.
Mrs. Pynsent looked from the window,
which Tom had long named the "screaming
window."</p>

<p>"I say, Miss Bell, don't cry, and come again
soon. Don't be down-hearted; your sister shall
always see <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>Christobelle heard no more, for the carriage
moved on, and she caught only one glance of
Anna Maria's window, as they drove round
the wooded knoll, which shut out the last
glimpse of Hatton.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>


<p>Lady Wetheral's reception of Sir John Spottiswoode
was most flatteringly kind. His arrival
had certainly taken great effect upon her spirits,
for she rose, at a bound, from listless, irritable
apathy, into the lively and amusing hostess.
Her mind appeared again full of employment,
and capable of every exertion. Sir John Spottiswoode
was at once inducted into all the mysteries
of Wetheral; and his peculiar tact in
quietly amalgamating with the different elements
of which they were composed, was admirably
exhibited in his visit. Sir John became Christobelle's
tutor in many accomplishments; he
argued literary points with her father; and he
was the depository of her mother's sentiments
and complaints. Such a visitor was worshipped
at Wetheral.</p>

<p>It was a new existence to Christobelle to enjoy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
perfect liberty&mdash;to be allowed to enter freely
into conversation in the boudoir&mdash;to be even
consulted&mdash;and to roam through the grounds
with Sir John Spottiswoode, without fearing
harsh and unkind remarks. On the contrary,
her intimate and improving acquaintance with
Sir John was encouraged, and even urged forward,
by Lady Wetheral. She approved the
hours devoted to drawing, to music, and to botany;
she smiled at their application, and
thanked, in grateful terms, "the polite consideration
of such a man as Sir John Spottiswoode,
devoting his hours to the education of a perfect
schoolgirl."</p>

<p>Christobelle certainly had never known happiness
unconnected with her father's library till
now. Never, till Sir John Spottiswoode arrived
at Wetheral, had she entered the precincts of the
boudoir without fear; and never, till his arrival,
had she felt the enthusiastic pleasure of associating
with a companion who could accompany
her in her wanderings, and lead her taste, as an
equal and a friend. She did truly love and
venerate the kind, considerate Sir John Spottiswoode&mdash;the
guide of her talents, and the companion
of her walks and rides. She no longer
lingered in the library, and listened for her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
father's step. She had now to fulfil the allotted
tasks of her new instructor, and his praise was
the goal of happiness to her young mind. She
only dreaded his departure from Wetheral; but
Sir John still lingered, and he did not talk of
Worcestershire.</p>

<p>The concerns of Ripley were now becoming
the engrossing topic of the neighbourhood.
Clara's haughty temper would not endure her
husband's domination, and the scenes which now
constantly occurred at Ripley, began to threaten
some direful termination. Since Sir Foster
Kerrison's interdiction of her mother's society,
Clara's spirit had increased in audacity, and a
separation was hinted at, among the reports of
the hour. Sir John Wetheral heard the general
rumour, and he sought an interview with Sir
Foster, some time after the arrival of Sir John
Spottiswoode at Wetheral. Sir Foster received
him with great politeness. Sir John at once
opened the subject to his son-in-law, and spoke
most feelingly and sorrowfully upon the nature
of the reports which had caused his visit to
Ripley. Sir Foster winked his eye during the
gentle remonstrance, and he tapped his boot
with quickness, when the propriety of a separation
was alluded to.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let her go&mdash;glad to get rid of a she-devil,"
was Sir Foster's laconic observation, as Sir John
concluded his remarks.</p>

<p>"I think, Sir Foster, a separation would be
advisable, since you cannot live together in
peace."</p>

<p>"Take her back with you, Sir John&mdash;devilish
glad!"</p>

<p>"There was no settlement, Sir Foster; but
you will make your lady an allowance out of
your ample fortune?"</p>

<p>"Not a penny," chuckled Sir Foster; "not a
halfpenny, by G&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"You will not allow your wife to be a burthen
to her friends, Sir Foster, since you received
ten thousand pounds as her portion?"</p>

<p>"Let her stay at home, then, and behave."</p>

<p>"My daughter is wrong, Sir Foster; I cannot
excuse Lady Kerrison, but I am willing to receive
her at Wetheral, to prevent the unpleasant
recurrence of domestic quarrels. You will make
your lady a stated allowance?"</p>

<p>"Take her clothes&mdash;nothing more, Sir John."</p>

<p>"This is a most painful and disagreeable task,"
observed Sir John; "but I must insist upon an
allowance for Lady Kerrison, before I withdraw
her from Ripley."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Foster chuckled and winked, as he repeated,
"not a halfpenny&mdash;not a penny; let her
take her clothes, and set off."</p>

<p>"I cannot take Lady Kerrison from your
house, without a proper understanding that an
allowance shall be paid to her regularly, Sir
Foster."</p>

<p>"Then let her stay at home, and behave."</p>

<p>Since the resolutions of Sir Foster could not
be shaken, her father resolved to seek an interview
with Clara, and represent to her reason the
turpitude of her conduct as a wife, and the
punishment which must accrue to her in the lost
affections of her husband, and the disesteem of
her friends. Lady Kerrison was accordingly
summoned to meet him in her husband's presence.</p>

<p>Clara entered the room with an air of haughty
defiance, which vanished at the sight of her
father. She rushed to him with open arms.
"My dear father, take me away from this ruffian&mdash;I
beseech you to take me away!"</p>

<p>Sir Foster winked and tapped his boot at the
sight of his lady, but he offered no opinion
during the dialogue which ensued between the
father and daughter. It seemed as if Sir Foster
Kerrison had no power to understand, or feeling
to be interested in any thing which had not a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
direct reference to himself. Sir John Wetheral
led Clara to a chair, and spoke in tones of deep
sorrow upon the subject which concerned so
nearly her respectability and happiness.</p>

<p>"I did not think, Lady Kerrison, I should be
doomed, by a child's forgetfulness to her duty,
to become a party against her. Report has
loudly declared what I have unfortunately witnessed
more than once at Ripley&mdash;that it has
become the scene of a wife's altercation with her
husband."</p>

<p>"It is the scene of a brute's treatment of an
unfortunate creature in his power," retorted
Clara&mdash;"it is the scene of violence, blasphemy,
and disgust. I desire to be taken from this
hateful place, and I will never see it more!"</p>

<p>"What has made you so forgetful of the duty
you decided so rashly upon assuming, Clara,
when you fled from your father's house?..."</p>

<p>"I know I did&mdash;I know I did!" shrieked Clara&mdash;"God
help me! I did leave my father's house,
but my mother helped my flight, and beset me
with her persuasions to marry that monster.
She caused the mischief, and she must bear the
blame. Who else had power to lead me into this
horrible snare, or direct my thoughts to wretchedness?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral was greatly distressed.</p>

<p>"Clara, it matters little now who guided you
into this luckless marriage. You have vowed,
at the altar, to obey the man you married, and
your submission to Sir Foster is your duty and
your vow."</p>

<p>"I vow to detest him all the days of my life!"
answered Clara, with scornful energy.</p>

<p>"Then," said her father, rising, "farewell,
Clara. I have no feelings to throw away upon
a disobedient wife&mdash;I can be of no use."</p>

<p>"Stay&mdash;stay," exclaimed Clara, rushing forward,
and detaining him&mdash;"stay, my dear father,
and hear me! <i>You</i> never taught me to marry
for this world's wealth&mdash;<i>you</i> never taught me to
barter happiness for a miserable title&mdash;for a low-minded,
disgusting creature like that"&mdash;she
pointed to Sir Foster with a shudder.&mdash;"<i>You</i>
were always good and gentle, so stay and hear
me."</p>

<p>"I beseech you, Clara, to command yourself,
and do not use this intemperate language," replied
her father, "or I cannot return: be calm,
and be rational."</p>

<p>"I will be so, papa; I should be very calm, if
I did not see that man before me."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will not listen to such improper, such
wicked language, Clara: hear me!"</p>

<p>"I do, papa."</p>

<p>"I have learned the fearful news of your
wretched and open quarrels, from common report;
and public opinion is against you, Clara, as it
ever will be against the daring and insolent
wife."</p>

<p>Clara's neck and face became suffused with
crimson, but she was silent.</p>

<p>"The world, Clara, saw your determination,
when you eloped with Sir Foster; let it see your
determination to remain constant and obedient,
now that he is your husband."</p>

<p>Clara burst into tears, and her head sank upon
her clasped hands, as she stood before her father.
She seemed struggling for composure. Sir John
seated her, and spoke strongly and feelingly
upon her situation. "Loved by none, and respected
by none, how was an imperious wife to
pass her remainder of existence, condemned to
opprobrium and contempt? How could a woman
presume to hope for happiness, when she
was breaking down the proprieties of life, and
offending her God by broken vows and unholy
thoughts?" Clara cast her weeping eyes upon
Sir Foster, as he sat buried in his easy chair,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
winking his eye, and appearing perfectly unconcerned
at her distress. Her spirit rose again
like the whirlwind at his sight&mdash;she started up.
"Let the world talk on&mdash;let it upbraid me with
every crime under heaven, I care not; but I will
not live with <i>him</i>&mdash;I will not look upon <i>him</i>&mdash;my
brain will not bear the constant misery of
living in this place&mdash;this wretched place&mdash;the
home of him who disgusts me so horribly! Oh,
take me away for ever!"</p>

<p>"Would you return to Wetheral, Clara?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no, not to Wetheral; my mother is
there. She only loves the wealthy and the high;
and she drove me to all this! As I hope to meet
with mercy, she drove me into this!"</p>

<p>"Be still, Clara, and listen to me once more,"
said her father.</p>

<p>"Nay, hear <i>me</i>," cried Clara, "and hear what
months of misery have passed away under the
influence of wine and laudanum. I have drank
wine, and I have drank laudanum, but it only
stills for the time! It is worse and worse to my
brain! Oh, take me home, or take me somewhere&mdash;but
here I cannot, will not stay!"</p>

<p>Sir John was anxious to remove Clara for a few
days from her home of wretchedness, and he appealed
again to the heart of Sir Foster Kerrison.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
He begged to take Lady Kerrison, for change of
air, to Wetheral. A few days only, he would
ask for his daughter's society: a few days might
be a short but beneficial visit to her own family.
Sir Foster chuckled.</p>

<p>"Take her home&mdash;never come back, I can tell
her."</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> return!" exclaimed Clara, with impetuosity;
"I will never be turned out of your
home: it was too great an honour ever to have
entered it, but I will enter it now, whenever I
please."</p>

<p>"Go along, you she-devil!"</p>

<p>Clara's violent spirit was not to be controlled.
She struck Sir Foster upon the face, with the
whole force of her delicate hand. The blow was
trifling in itself, but it raised the equally strong
passions of the person on whom it was directed.
Sir Foster rose furious with passion, and kicked
his lady with brutal and senseless anger. This
scene determined her father no longer to endure
his daughter's situation at Ripley. He ordered
his carriage round, without a moment's delay, to
withdraw Clara from the presence of her husband.
It was a scene of horror to his excellent and
indulgent mind.</p>

<p>Both parties had acted wickedly and weakly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Clara deserved punishment for her insolent and
unfeminine action, in striking her husband; but
it was unbecoming and dreadful in Sir Foster,
to wreak his fury upon a defenceless woman.
Ripley was not the proper home for Clara: since
Sir Foster and herself could not preserve even
the decencies of appearance, it was better to
part at once. Sir John would place Lady Kerrison
in his own house&mdash;under his own protection;
and if Sir Foster persevered in declining
to allow her a proper maintenance, the law should
decide the question. The carriage drew up, but
Clara was not in a condition to be moved. The
violence of her anger, combined with her screams
of terror, had ruptured a blood-vessel, and she
sunk at her father's feet, deluged with the blood
which streamed from her mouth. Clara was
carried to her bed by her father and Sir Foster,
who had rushed from his seat, and now winked
his eye with astonishment and regret; he bore
his suffering lady in silence to her room; and,
though in spite of the chastening hand which
had dealt the calamity, Clara twice endeavoured
to push him from her, Sir Foster remained by
her bed-side in nervous distress.</p>

<p>Sir John ordered the carriage to proceed instantly
for his lady, who was desired to set out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
without any delay, and an express was sent to
summon Dr. Darwin. All was confusion at Ripley.
Sir Foster, except when his eye caught the
blood-stained dress of Clara, who lay almost insensible,
could scarcely remember the events of
the hour: he did not utter a word, or join in the
orders which were issued by Sir John Wetheral;
but his usual habit of winking and making low
short coughs, indicated his satisfaction that some
one did act for himself and the unfortunate Clara.</p>

<p>Dr. Darwin arrived first, and his prompt mind
applied the proper remedies which the sufferer's
case required. He remained that day and night
at Ripley. Lady Wetheral had most unexpectedly
encountered the Hatton carriage as she
drove out of the Wetheral lodges; and, deeply
as she deprecated Mrs. Pynsent's boisterous and
offensive conduct towards herself, she now gladly
availed herself of her useful and more powerful
mind, under the emergency of the moment. The
kind-hearted Mrs. Pynsent listened to her ladyship's
statement, and took instant measures to
render herself of use to the shocked and distressed
mind of her companion.</p>

<p>She entered Lady Wetheral's carriage, and,
sending her own back to Hatton, with a message
to her son, she prepared to assist in the melancholy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
charge of Clara. She was well aware of
her ladyship's perfect helplessness in situations
which required promptness of thought and action;
she was equally well assured that the
dreadful circumstance must have originated in
Clara's alarming explosions of temper. Mrs.
Pynsent was therefore prepared to act the Christian
part of adviser and nurse to the ill-fated
Clara, and to the woman she despised. In the
hour of need, Mrs. Pynsent developed all the
real excellence of the female character.</p>

<p>Clara lay silent and exhausted, when Mrs.
Pynsent and her mother entered her room. Her
eyes rested with an expression of satisfaction
upon the former, as she preceded her weeping
companion to the bed-side; but they flashed with
emotion when she perceived the figure of the author
of her misery. She waved her hand, and
would have risen in her bed, but Mrs. Pynsent
prevented the movement. She placed Clara's
hands with gentleness beneath the bedclothes,
and signed to her, by placing her finger on her
lips, that silence was absolutely necessary on her
part. Clara again raised her hands, to wave her
mother away, and exclaimed, in low and thick
accents, "Don't let her come here. Is she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
coming to lecture me about my misery?&mdash;it was
her own doing."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush," whispered Mrs. Pynsent, "no
one is come to lecture you&mdash;only to nurse you."</p>

<p>"I saw my mother, just now; I know she is
come to upbraid and jeer me. She made me
marry a ruffian&mdash;and it roused my nature. I
might have been better; but she would have me
do it."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush!" repeated Mrs. Pynsent, signing
to Lady Wetheral to withdraw; "there is no one
here but Dr. Darwin and myself."</p>

<p>"Is there not?" said Clara, faintly.</p>

<p>"Lady Wetheral is <i>not</i> here, Lady Kerrison.
Be calm, and be silent, I entreat you."</p>

<p>"I will," replied Clara, "but don't leave me.
Stay with me, Mrs. Pynsent."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent remained by the side of Lady
Kerrison, till she slept; and her place was taken
silently, and at a late hour, by the doctor, who
enjoined the strictest quiet to be preserved. At
eight o'clock the following morning, Clara woke
from a slumber produced by narcotics. Dr. Darwin
named to his patient, Lady Wetheral's wish
to watch by her bed-side, in the gentlest manner,
and he approached her name with great caution;
but Clara shuddered and became feverish.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let no one speak of my mother," she said,
"unless they want to kill me."</p>

<p>It was useless to contend with Clara's wishes.
The very allusion to her mother's name raised a
discordant spirit, and threw her into almost convulsive
alarms. Mrs. Pynsent, therefore, fixed
herself at the bed-side of Lady Kerrison. Clara
slumbered through the day, and appeared so
calm, that the doctor quitted Ripley for a few
hours. Mrs. Pynsent was all-sufficient to meet
any little change which might take place before
his return, but he did not anticipate any thing
to give alarm, provided she was kept in profound
quiet. A change, however, did occur. Clara
woke suddenly, with very feverish and alarming
symptoms. "She had dreamt of her father,
and she wished to see his kind face. She could
not rest again, unless she beheld him." Mrs.
Pynsent renewed the dose of laudanum, and
Clara again slumbered.</p>

<p>Sir Foster Kerrison suffered as much agitation
as his nature was capable of enduring. He sat
close to Lady Wetheral, in the sitting-room, and
did not offer to resume his daily round of occupation.
He did not visit the stable, or enter the
kitchen; and his attention was riveted upon
Lucy, as she glided to and fro, between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
dressing-room and sitting-room, to give from
time to time the last accounts of the progress in
the sick chamber.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral waited, in calm acquiescence,
the issue of that day's events. He believed
Clara to be beyond all hope of a permanent
recovery, but he prayed in silence to the
Giver of all good, that her life might yet be
spared, to become a penitent, and gain self-command
by her trials. Lady Wetheral wept severely,
but she could not believe her own hands
had prepared her child's sorrow. "It was harsh
and ill-judged of Clara to decline her own parent,
and accept the attentions of a comparative
stranger, especially after the efforts she had
made to procure her present eligible position.
She deserved more gratitude at the hands of
her children&mdash;but she had done her duty, and
the world would do her justice." Nevertheless,
her ladyship wept, and suffered sincere distress
at her banishment from her daughter's couch.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent was Clara's watchful and most
kind attendant; from her hands she received
her medicines without a murmur, and forbore
to agitate herself with asking questions, according
to her expressed wish. Towards evening,
however, fever again rose high, and Mrs. Pynsent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
felt that all hope was over, and that her
patient must sink under its raging influence.
Clara again demanded to see her father; and,
from her excited state, Mrs. Pynsent deemed it
prudent to acquiesce. Her exertions were the
feverish and uncertain effects of a roused, though
dying spirit, which would terminate fearfully
and suddenly, when its strength should exhaust.
When her father entered the chamber, Clara rose
up in her bed, and extended her arms towards
him. "Dear, good papa, you are come to see
me"&mdash;her thoughts took another and more distressing
direction; and her eyes, flashing with
scorn, became gradually heavy and half-closed,
as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Look at poor Clara, wedded to riches, and
see her state <i>now</i>! Where is she? Where is
Lady Kerrison, of Ripley? Where is the mother
who sacrificed her child, and why does she not
come to look upon me? Let her look&mdash;I am
here, struck down&mdash;dying!" A copious hemorrhage
succeeded the last words, and Clara never
more spoke. Before Dr. Darwin returned to
Ripley, Lady Kerrison was gone to her rest.</p>

<p>And this was the fate of Clara Wetheral! the
young and beautiful Clara! Scarcely passed the
bounds of childhood, her days were sacrificed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the false light of ambitious hope, which, like the
delusive Will-o'-the-wisp, led her only into the
darkest and most impassable paths. Like the
Will-o'-the-wisp, it lured her on, and deserted
her in her hour of need. Few and evil were the
married days of Clara. Her maid disclosed, at
the death of her mistress, the secrets of the dead.
Clara had habituated herself to the fatal influence
of laudanum, upon every dissention with
her husband; and she had endeavoured to drown
the remembrance of her error, in potent and
destroying libations. Her father remembered
that she had alluded to the baneful practice, on
the morning of his last visit.</p>

<p>Sir Foster Kerrison winked with more nervous
rapidity than was his usual custom, when Mrs.
Pynsent announced to him the death of his wife;
but his mind appeared relieved by the knowledge
that she would no more appear before him, to reproach
and annoy. Mrs. Pynsent's remarks to
Sir Foster, immediately after her announcement
of the event, was either unheard or unheeded.</p>

<p>"Now you have killed two wives, you be quiet,
and don't bring a woman to Ripley again, for they
can't live in peace here. I wonder how you had
the face to marry at all; but your first wife's
family shut you up, and hid your coat, that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
mightn't be off on the wedding-day; and we all
know how the second wife was managed, so you
are a poor thing, in spite of your temper. When
the girls marry you in spite of yourself, be quiet
and temperate, like Bobby."</p>

<p>Clara's funeral was attended by few, and it
took place by torch-light, in the church of Ripley.
Sir Foster sat perfectly quiet in his easy
chair, and allowed Sir John Wetheral to superintend
the arrangements of his lady's last removal
from his home. He would not hear of any attendance,
or indite an invitation to his friends;
but he followed the <i>cortège</i> to the church, and
remained watching the workmen as they closed
up the vault. The following day, Sir Foster
was busily employed dragging the lake, with his
servants.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral had a severe illness upon her
removal from Ripley, which threatened fatal consequences.
Again, Mrs. Pynsent appeared as the
good Samaritan, and assisted Christobelle in long
and fatiguing watches. Sir John Spottiswoode
also remained at Wetheral, and his attentions
were very soothing to his friends. Christobelle
feared lest Anna Maria should feel the constant
absence of her mother-in-law, who daily visited
Wetheral, and remained even through the night,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
when her ladyship relapsed; but Mrs. Pynsent
set aside all her fears. "Tom was left to take
care of his wife and child, and poor Bobby, who
was half another. Tom, God bless him! was like
the Irishman's bird&mdash;he could be in two places
at once. She had great pleasure in being useful
to her poor, dear, honest Bell, who got more
kicks than halfpence from my lady, and come
she would."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral recovered very slowly, but her
spirits were severely depressed, and nothing appeared
to give pleasure to her mind. The Boscawens
came to Wetheral, upon Sir John's departure,
for it was thought their presence might
rouse her attention. Isabel, truly happy in maternal
cares, looked the picture of animated
health, as Mr. Boscawen proudly and silently
watched her erratic movements, and gloried in
his lively, sweet-tempered wife. But her mother
looked heavily and unconsciously upon the scene,
and did not notice the gambols of her grandchild.
Even the sight of Anna Maria failed to
take effect upon her attention.</p>

<p>It was thought prudent to change the air and
scene. By her medical attendant's advice, Sir
John resolved to quit, for some time, the scenes
which brought the fate of her daughter before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
her mental sight; and it was hoped a perfectly
new situation, new people, and a complete change
in every point, would effect a gradual restoration
of her faculties and health. It was decided
Lady Wetheral should spend two or three years
at Fairlee. Scotland was remote from all recollections
and painful reminiscence&mdash;there was
nothing at Fairlee which could be connected
with the departed; and, perhaps, among the
grander scenery of the North, its bracing air,
and novel inhabitants, Lady Wetheral might forget
her banishment from the deathbed of the
child who had reproached her as the cause of
her bitter sufferings and untimely death. When
her ladyship was able to leave her room without
effort, the family set forth on their distant
journey.</p>

<p>The Boscawens parted with Christobelle under
many regrets, and they promised to join them at
Fairlee, the ensuing year. Christobelle wept over
her sisters&mdash;she wept over the little ones she must
leave far behind&mdash;but her father was with her,
and he would again be her companion, as he had
been for thirteen years, in the happy tranquillity
of Wetheral library. Mrs. Pynsent promised to
correspond with Christobelle, and give her the
news of the neighbourhood. She prophecied
respecting Sir Foster Kerrison.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>"That fellow will be run down again, in spite
of his two wives dying. You may depend upon
it, the fellow will be married again, without his
own consent, or being consulted in the matter.
The deuce was in the mothers!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent also winked her eye at Mr. Boscawen,
and assured him, "Jacky Spottiswoode
had an eye to Miss Bell&mdash;she could see <i>that</i>.
Jacky would wait three or four years, and then
pop. She thought my lady had another trial to
endure; for she was not Pen Pynsent, if that
poor Lady Ennismore came to good. What with
the tartar Countess, that poor wizen Lord, and
the fine-looking Colonel, Julia would be the next
sacrifice;&mdash;every thing would come home to my
Lady Wetheral."</p>

<p>How Christobelle wept as she drove away from
the scenes of her youth, and the hearts she loved!
How Christobelle wept when she could see no
more the woods of Wetheral Castle!</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
